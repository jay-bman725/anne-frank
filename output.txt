BACKGROUND
In Act I, Anne Frank’s father visits the attic where his family and 
four others hid from the Nazis during World War II. As he holds his 
daughter’s diary, Anne’s offstage voice draws him into the past as 
the families begin their new life in hiding. As the months drag on, 
fear and lack of privacy in the attic rooms contribute to increasing 
tension among the family members. 
Scene 1
[In the darkness we hear Anne’s Voice, again reading from the 
diary.]
Anne’s Voice. Saturday, the first of January, nineteen forty-
four. Another new year has begun and we find ourselves still 
in our hiding place. We have been here now for one year, five 
months and twenty-five days. It seems that our life is at a 
standstill.
[The curtain rises on the scene. It is late afternoon. Everyone is 
bundled up against the cold. In the main room Mrs. Frank is 
taking down the laundry which is hung across the back. Mr. Frank

sits in the chair down left, reading. Margot is lying on the couch 
with a blanket over her and the many-colored knitted scarf around 
her throat. Anne is seated at the center table, writing in her diary. 
Peter, Mr. and Mrs. Van Daan and Dussel are all in their own 
rooms, reading or lying down. 
As the lights dim on, Anne’s Voice continues, without a break.]
Anne’s Voice. We are all a little thinner. The Van Daans’ 
“discussions” are as violent as ever. Mother still does not 
understand me. But then I don’t understand her either. There 
is one great change, however. A change in myself. I read 
somewhere that girls of my age don’t feel quite certain of 
themselves. That they become quiet within and begin to 
think of the miracle that is taking place in their bodies. I think 
that what is happening to me is so wonderful . . . not only 
what can be seen, but what is taking place inside. Each time it 
has happened I have a feeling that I have a sweet secret.
[We hear the chimes and then a hymn being played on the carillon 
outside. The buzzer of the door below suddenly sounds. Everyone is 
startled. Mr. Frank tiptoes cautiously to the top of the steps and 
listens. Again the buzzer sounds, in Miep’s V-for-Victory signal.1]
Mr. Frank. It’s Miep!
[He goes quickly down the steps to unbolt the door. Mrs. Frank 
calls upstairs to the Van Daans and then to Peter.]
Mrs. Frank. Wake up, everyone! Miep is here!
[Anne quickly puts her diary away. Margot sits up, pulling the 
blanket around her shoulders. Mr. Dussel sits on the edge of his 
bed, listening, disgruntled. Miep comes up the steps, followed by 
Mr. Kraler. They bring flowers, books, newspapers, etc. Anne 
rushes to Miep, throwing her arms affectionately around her.] 
Miep . . . and Mr. Kraler . . . What a delightful surprise!
Mr. Kraler. We came to bring you New Year’s greetings.
Mrs. Frank. You shouldn’t . . . you should have at least one 
day to yourselves. [She goes quickly to the stove and brings down 
teacups and tea for all of them.]
Anne. Don’t say that, it’s so wonderful to see them! [Sniffing 
at Miep’s coat] I can smell the wind and the cold on your 
clothes.
Miep. [Giving her the flowers] There you are. [Then to Margot, 
feeling her forehead] How are you, Margot? . . . Feeling any 
better?
Margot. I’m all right.
Anne. We filled her full of every kind of pill so she won’t 
cough and make a noise. [She runs into her room to put the

Outside there is the sound of a band playing.]
Mrs. Van Daan. Well, hello, Miep. Mr. Kraler.
Mr. Kraler. [Giving a bouquet of flowers to Mrs. Van Daan] With 
my hope for peace in the New Year.
Peter. [Anxiously] Miep, have you seen Mouschi? Have you 
seen him anywhere around?
Miep. I’m sorry, Peter. I asked everyone in the neighborhood 
had they seen a gray cat. But they said no.
[Mrs. Frank gives Miep a cup of tea. Mr. Frank comes up the 
steps, carrying a small cake on a plate.]
Mr. Frank. Look what Miep’s brought for us!
Mrs. Frank. [Taking it] A cake!
Mr. Van Daan. A cake! [He pinches Miep’s cheeks gaily and 
hurries up to the cupboard.] I’ll get some plates.
[Dussel, in his room, hastily puts a coat on and starts out to join 
the others.]
Mrs. Frank. Thank you, Miepia. You shouldn’t have done it. 
You must have used all of your sugar ration for weeks. 
[Giving it to Mrs. Van Daan] It’s beautiful, isn’t it?
Mrs. Van Daan. It’s been ages since I even saw a cake. Not 
since you brought us one last year. [Without looking at the 
cake, to Miep] Remember? Don’t you remember, you gave us 
one on New Year’s Day? Just this time last year? I’ll never 
forget it because you had “Peace in nineteen forty-three” 
on it. [She looks at the cake and reads] “Peace in nineteen 
forty-four!”
Miep. Well, it has to come sometime, you know. [As Dussel 
comes from his room] Hello, Mr. Dussel.
Mr. Kraler. How are you?
Mr. Van Daan. [Bringing plates and a knife] Here’s the knife, 
liefje. Now, how many of us are there?
Miep. None for me, thank you.
Mr. Frank. Oh, please. You must.
Miep. I couldn’t.
Mr. Van Daan. Good! That leaves one . . . two . . . three . . . 
seven of us.
Dussel. Eight! Eight! It’s the same number as it always is!
Mr. Van Daan. I left Margot out. I take it for granted Margot 
won’t eat any.

sugar cake does to us? It goes right to our heads!

Dussel. Make up your mind, already someone has had a nice 
big dinner from that cat!
[Peter is furious, inarticulate. He starts toward Dussel, as if to hit 
him. Mr. Frank stops him. Mrs. Frank speaks quickly to ease the 
situation.]
Mrs. Frank. [To Miep] This is delicious, Miep!
Mrs. Van Daan. [Eating hers] Delicious!
Mr. Van Daan. [Finishing it in one gulp] Dirk’s in luck to get a 
girl who can bake like this!
Miep. [Putting down her empty teacup] I have to run. Dirk’s 
taking me to a party tonight.
Anne. How heavenly! Remember now what everyone is 
wearing, and what you have to eat and everything, so you 
can tell us tomorrow.
Miep. I’ll give you a full report! Good-bye, everyone!
Mr. Van Daan. [To Miep] Just a minute. There’s something I’d 
like you to do for me. 
[He hurries off up the stairs to his room.]
Mrs. Van Daan. [Sharply] Putti, where are you going? [She 
rushes up the stairs after him, calling hysterically.] What do you 
want? Putti, what are you going to do?
Miep. [To Peter] What’s wrong?
Peter. [His sympathy is with his mother.] Father says he’s going 
to sell her fur coat. She’s crazy about that old fur coat.
Dussel. Is it possible? Is it possible that anyone is so silly as 
to worry about a fur coat in times like this?
Peter. It’s none of your darn business . . . and if you say one 
more thing . . . I’ll, I’ll take you and I’ll . . . I mean it . . . I’ll . . .
[There is a piercing scream from Mrs. Van Daan above. She grabs 
at the fur coat as Mr. Van Daan is starting downstairs with it.]
Mrs. Van Daan. No! No! No! Don’t you dare take that! You 
hear? It’s mine! [Downstairs Peter turns away, embarrassed, 
miserable.] My father gave me that! You didn’t give it to me. 
You have no right. Let go of it . . . you hear?
[Mr. Van Daan pulls the coat from her hands and hurries 
downstairs. Mrs. Van Daan sinks to the floor, sobbing. As 
Mr. Van Daan comes into the main room the others look away, 
embarrassed for him.]

coat to Miep.] So if you will please to sell it for us? It should 
fetch a good price. And by the way, will you get me 
cigarettes. I don’t care what kind they are . . . get all you can. 
Miep. It’s terribly difficult to get them, Mr. Van Daan. But I’ll 
try. Good-bye.
[She goes. Mr. Frank follows her down the steps to bolt the door 
after her. Mrs. Frank gives Mr. Kraler a cup of tea.]
Mrs. Frank. Are you sure you won’t have some cake, 
Mr. Kraler?
Mr. Kraler. I’d better not.
Mr. Van Daan. You’re still feeling badly? What does your 
doctor say?
Mr. Kraler. I haven’t been to him. 
Mrs. Frank. Now, Mr. Kraler! . . .
Mr. Kraler. [Sitting at the table] Oh, I tried. But you can’t get 
near a doctor these days . . . they’re so busy. After weeks I 
finally managed to get one on the telephone. I told him I’d 
like an appointment . . . I wasn’t feeling very well. You know 
what he answers . . . over the telephone . . . Stick out your 
tongue! [They laugh. He turns to Mr. Frank as Mr. Frank comes 
back.] I have some contracts here . . . I wonder if you’d look 
over them with me . . .
Mr. Frank. [Putting out his hand] Of course.
Mr. Kraler. [He rises] If we could go downstairs . . . [Mr. Frank 
starts ahead; Mr. Kraler speaks to the others.] Will you forgive 
us? I won’t keep him but a minute. [He starts to follow 
Mr. Frank down the steps.]
Margot. [With sudden foreboding] What’s happened? 
Something’s happened! Hasn’t it, Mr. Kraler?
[Mr. Kraler stops and comes back, trying to reassure Margot with 
a pretense of casualness.]
Mr. Kraler. No, really. I want your father’s advice . . .
Margot. Something’s gone wrong! I know it!
Mr. Frank. [Coming back, to Mr. Kraler] If it’s something that 
concerns us here, it’s better that we all hear it.
Mr. Kraler. [Turning to him, quietly] But . . . the children . . . ?
Mr. Frank. What they’d imagine would be worse than any

Mr. Kraler. It’s a man in the storeroom . . . I don’t know 
whether or not you remember him . . . Carl, about fifty, heavy-
set, nearsighted . . . He came with us just before you left.
Mr. Frank. He was from Utrecht?
Mr. Kraler. That’s the man. A couple of weeks ago, when I 
was in the storeroom, he closed the door and asked me . . . 
how’s Mr. Frank? What do you hear from Mr. Frank? I told 
him I only knew there was a rumor that you were in 
Switzerland. He said he’d heard that rumor too, but he 
thought I might know something more. I didn’t pay any 
attention to it . . . but then a thing happened yesterday . . . 
He’d brought some invoices to the office for me to sign. As I 
was going through them, I looked up. He was standing 
staring at the bookcase . . . your bookcase. He said he thought 
he remembered a door there . . . Wasn’t there a door there 
that used to go up to the loft? Then he told me he wanted 
more money. Twenty guilders2 more a week.
Mr. Van Daan. Blackmail!
Mr. Frank. Twenty guilders? Very modest blackmail.
Mr. Van Daan. That’s just the beginning.
Dussel. [Coming to Mr. Frank] You know what I think? He 
was the thief who was down there that night. That’s how he 
knows we’re here.
Mr. Frank. [To Mr. Kraler] How was it left? What did you 
tell him?
Mr. Kraler. I said I had to think about it. What shall I do? Pay 
him the money? . . . Take a chance on firing him . . . or what? 
I don’t know.
Dussel. [Frantic] Don’t fire him! Pay him what he asks . . . 
keep him here where you can have your eye on him.
Mr. Frank. Is it so much that he’s asking? What are they 
paying nowadays?
Mr. Kraler. He could get it in a war plant. But this isn’t a war 
plant. Mind you. I don’t know if he really knows . . . or if he 
doesn’t know.
Mr. Frank. Offer him half. Then we’ll soon find out if it’s 
blackmail or not.
Dussel. And if it is? We’ve got to pay it, haven’t we? 
Anything he asks we’ve got to pay!
Mr. Frank. Let’s decide that when the time comes.
Mr. Kraler. This may be all my imagination. You get to a

Mrs. Van Daan. [Hurrying to Mr. Kraler] There’s the 
telephone! What does that mean, the telephone ringing on a 
holiday?
Mr. Kraler. That’s my wife. I told her I had to go over some 
papers in my office . . . to call me there when she got out of 
church. [He starts out.] I’ll offer him half then. Goodbye . . .

arms around her.]
Margot. Then at least we’d know where we were.
Mrs. Frank. You should be ashamed of yourself! Talking that 
way! Think how lucky we are! Think of the thousands dying 
in the war, every day. Think of the people in concentration 
camps.
Anne. [Interrupting] What’s the good of that? What’s the 
good of thinking of misery when you’re already miserable? 
That’s stupid!
Mrs. Frank. Anne!
[As Anne goes on raging at her mother, Mrs. Frank tries to break 
in, in an effort to quiet her.]
Anne. We’re young, Margot and Peter and I! You grownups 
have had your chance! But look at us . . . If we begin thinking 
of all the horror in the world, we’re lost! We’re trying to hold 
onto some kind of ideals . . . when everything . . . ideals, 
hopes . . . everything, are being destroyed! It isn’t our fault 
that the world is in such a mess! We weren’t around when all 
this started! So don’t try to take it out on us! [She rushes off to 
her room, slamming the door after her. She picks up a brush from 
the chest and hurls it to the floor. Then she sits on the settee, trying

window. Mr. Frank brings Mrs. Frank her cake. She eats it slowly, 
without relish. Mr. Frank takes his cake to Margot and sits quietly 
on the sofa beside her. Peter stands in the doorway of Anne’s 
darkened room, looking at her, then makes a little movement to let 
her know he is there. Anne sits up, quickly, trying to hide the signs 
of her tears. Peter holds out the cake to her.] You left this.
Anne. [Dully] Thanks.

wrong. I say too much. I go too far. I hurt people’s feelings . . .
[Dussel leaves the window, going to his room.]
Peter. I think you’re just fine . . . What I want to say . . . if it 
wasn’t for you around here, I don’t know. What I mean . . .

stands in the doorway, startled to see Peter. Peter advances toward 
him forbiddingly. Dussel backs out of the room. Peter closes the

Anne. Wouldn’t you like some in your room? I could give 
you some. Heaven knows you spend enough time in there . . .

Peter. It’s easier. A fight starts, or an argument . . . I duck 
in there.
Anne. You’re lucky, having a room to go to. His lordship is 
always here . . . I hardly ever get a minute alone. When they 
start in on me, I can’t duck away. I have to stand there and 
take it.
Peter. You gave some of it back just now.
Anne. I get so mad. They’ve formed their opinions . . . about 
everything . . . but we . . . we’re still trying to find out . . . We 
have problems here that no other people our age have ever 
had. And just as you think you’ve solved them, something 
comes along and bang! You have to start all over again.
Peter. At least you’ve got someone you can talk to.
Anne. Not really. Mother . . . I never discuss anything serious 
with her. She doesn’t understand. Father’s all right. We can 
talk about everything . . . everything but one thing. Mother. 
He simply won’t talk about her. I don’t think you can be 
really intimate with anyone if he holds something back, 
do you?
Peter. I think your father’s fine.
Anne. Oh, he is, Peter! He is! He’s the only one who’s ever 
given me the feeling that I have any sense. But anyway, 
nothing can take the place of school and play and friends of 
your own age . . . or near your age . . . can it?
Peter. I suppose you miss your friends and all.
Anne. It isn’t just . . . [She breaks off, staring up at him for a 
second.] Isn’t it funny, you and I? Here we’ve been seeing each 
other every minute for almost a year and a half, and this is 
the first time we’ve ever really talked. It helps a lot to have 
someone to talk to, don’t you think? It helps you to let off 
steam.
Peter. [Going to the door] Well, any time you want to let off 
steam, you can come into my room.
Anne. [Following him] I can get up an awful lot of steam. 
You’ll have to be careful how you say that.
Peter. It’s all right with me.
Anne. Do you mean it?
Peter. I said it, didn’t I?

[He goes out. Anne stands in her doorway looking after him. As 
Peter gets to his door he stands for a minute looking back at her. 
Then he goes into his room. Dussel rises as he comes in, and 
quickly passes him, going out. He starts across for his room. Anne 
sees him coming, and pulls her door shut. Dussel turns back 
toward Peter’s room. Peter pulls his door shut. Dussel stands 
there, bewildered, forlorn.
The scene slowly dims out. The curtain falls on the scene. 
Anne’s Voice comes over in the darkness . . . faintly at first, and 
then with growing strength.]
Anne’s Voice. We’ve had bad news. The people from whom 
Miep got our ration books have been arrested. So we have 
had to cut down on our food. Our stomachs are so empty that 
they rumble and make strange noises, all in different keys. 
Mr. Van Daan’s is deep and low, like a bass fiddle. Mine is 
high, whistling like a flute. As we all sit around waiting for 
supper, it’s like an orchestra tuning up. It only needs 
Toscanini3 to raise his baton and we’d be off in the Ride of the 
Valkyries.4 Monday, the sixth of March, nineteen forty-four. 
Mr. Kraler is in the hospital. It seems he has ulcers. Pim says 
we are his ulcers. Miep has to run the business and us too. 
The Americans have landed on the southern tip of Italy. 
Father looks for a quick finish to the war. Mr. Dussel is 
waiting every day for the warehouse man to demand more 
money. Have I been skipping too much from one subject to 
another? I can’t help it. I feel that spring is coming. I feel it 
in my whole body and soul. I feel utterly confused. I am 
longing . . . so longing . . . for everything . . . for friends . . . for 
someone to talk to . . . someone who understands . . . 
someone young, who feels as I do . . .
[As these last lines are being said, the curtain rises on the scene. 
The lights dim on. Anne’s Voice fades out.]

Scene 2
[It is evening, after supper. From outside we hear the sound of 
children playing. The “grownups,” with the exception of Mr. Van 
Daan, are all in the main room. Mrs. Frank is doing some 
mending. Mrs. Van Daan is reading a fashion magazine. 
Mr. Frank is going over business accounts.

Dussel, in his dentist’s jacket, is pacing up and down, impatient to 
get into his bedroom. Mr. Van Daan is upstairs working on a piece 
of embroidery in an embroidery frame.
In his room Peter is sitting before the mirror, smoothing his hair. 
As the scene goes on, he puts on his tie, brushes his coat and puts it 
on, preparing himself meticulously for a visit from Anne. On his 
wall are now hung some of Anne’s motion picture stars.
In her room Anne too is getting dressed. She stands before the 
mirror in her slip, trying various ways of dressing her hair. Margot 
is seated on the sofa, hemming a skirt for Anne to wear.
In the main room Dussel can stand it no longer. He comes over, 
rapping sharply on the door of his and Anne’s bedroom.]
Anne. [Calling to him] No, no, Mr. Dussel! I am not dressed 
yet. [Dussel walks away, furious, sitting down and burying his 
head in his hands. Anne turns to Margot.] How is that? How 
does that look?
Margot. [Glancing at her briefly] Fine.
Anne. You didn’t even look.
Margot. Of course I did. It’s fine.
Anne. Margot, tell me, am I terribly ugly?
Margot. Oh, stop fishing.
Anne. No. No. Tell me.
Margot. Of course you’re not. You’ve got nice eyes . . . and a 
lot of animation, and . . .
Anne. A little vague, aren’t you?
[She reaches over and takes a brassiere out of Margot’s sewing 
basket. She holds it up to herself, studying the effect in the mirror. 
Outside, Mrs. Frank, feeling sorry for Dussel, comes over, 
knocking at the girls’ door.]
Mrs. Frank. [Outside] May I come in?
Margot. Come in, Mother.
Mrs. Frank. [Shutting the door behind her] Mr. Dussel’s 
impatient to get in here.
Anne. [Still with the brassiere] Heavens, he takes the room for 
himself the entire day.
Mrs. Frank. [Gently] Anne, dear, you’re not going in again 
tonight to see Peter?
Anne. [Dignified] That is my intention.
Mrs. Frank. But you’ve already spent a great deal of time in 
there today.

Anne. I was in there exactly twice. Once to get the dictionary, 
and then three-quarters of an hour before supper.
Mrs. Frank. Aren’t you afraid you’re disturbing him?
Anne. Mother, I have some intuition. 
Mrs. Frank. Then may I ask you this much, Anne. Please 
don’t shut the door when you go in.
Anne. You sound like Mrs. Van Daan! [She throws the brassiere 
back in Margot’s sewing basket and picks up her blouse, 
putting it on.]
Mrs. Frank. No. No. I don’t mean to suggest anything wrong. 
I only wish that you wouldn’t expose yourself to criticism . . . 
that you wouldn’t give Mrs. Van Daan the opportunity to be 
unpleasant.
Anne. Mrs. Van Daan doesn’t need an opportunity to be 
unpleasant!
Mrs. Frank. Everyone’s on edge, worried about Mr. Kraler. 
This is one more thing . . .
Anne. I’m sorry, Mother. I’m going to Peter’s room. I’m not 
going to let Petronella Van Daan spoil our friendship.
[Mrs. Frank hesitates for a second, then goes out, closing the door 
after her. She gets a pack of playing cards and sits at the center 
table, playing solitaire. In Anne’s room Margot hands the finished 
skirt to Anne. As Anne is putting it on, Margot takes off her 
high-heeled shoes and stuffs paper in the toes so that Anne can 
wear them.]

Margot. [To Anne] Why don’t you two talk in the main 
room? It’d save a lot of trouble. It’s hard on Mother, having 
to listen to those remarks from Mrs. Van Daan and not say 
a word.
Anne. Why doesn’t she say a word? I think it’s ridiculous to 
take it and take it.
Margot. You don’t understand Mother at all, do you? She 
can’t talk back. She’s not like you. It’s just not in her nature to 
fight back.
Anne. Anyway . . . the only one I worry about is you. I feel 
awfully guilty about you. [She sits on the stool near Margot, 
putting on Margot’s high-heeled shoes.]
Margot. What about?
Anne. I mean, every time I go into Peter’s room, I have a 
feeling I may be hurting you. [Margot shakes her head.] I 
know if it were me, I’d be wild. I’d be desperately jealous, if 
it were me.
Margot. Well, I’m not.
Anne. You don’t feel badly? Really? Truly? You’re not 
jealous?
Margot. Of course I’m jealous . . . jealous that you’ve got 
something to get up in the morning for . . . But jealous of you 
and Peter? No.
[Anne goes back to the mirror.]
Anne. Maybe there’s nothing to be jealous of. Maybe he 
doesn’t really like me. Maybe I’m just taking the place of his 
cat . . . [She picks up a pair of short white gloves, putting them on.] 
Wouldn’t you like to come in with us?
Margot. I have a book.
[The sound of the children playing outside fades out. In the main 
room Dussel can stand it no longer. He jumps up, going to the 
bedroom door and knocking sharply.
Dussel. Will you please let me in my room!
Anne. Just a minute, dear, dear Mr. Dussel. [She picks up her 
mother’s pink stole and adjusts it elegantly over her shoulders, then 
gives a last look in the mirror.] Well, here I go . . . to run the 
gauntlet.5
[She starts out, followed by Margot.]
Dussel. [As she appears—sarcastic] Thank you so much.
[Dussel goes into his room. Anne goes toward Peter’s room, 
passing Mrs. Van Daan and her parents at the center table.]

Mrs. Van Daan. My God, look at her! [Anne pays no attention. 
She knocks at Peter’s door.] I don’t know what good it is to 
have a son. I never see him. He wouldn’t care if I killed 
myself. [Peter opens the door and stands aside for Anne to come 
in.] Just a minute, Anne. [She goes to them at the door.] I’d like 
to say a few words to my son. Do you mind? [Peter and Anne 
stand waiting.] Peter, I don’t want you staying up till all hours 
tonight. You’ve got to have your sleep. You’re a growing boy. 
You hear?
Mrs. Frank. Anne won’t stay late. She’s going to bed 
promptly at nine. Aren’t you, Anne?
Anne. Yes, Mother . . . [To Mrs. Van Daan] May we go now?
Mrs. Van Daan. Are you asking me? I didn’t know I had 
anything to say about it.
Mrs. Frank. Listen for the chimes, Anne dear.
[The two young people go off into Peter’s room, shutting the door 
after them.]
Mrs. Van Daan. [To Mrs. Frank] In my day it was the boys 
who called on the girls. Not the girls on the boys.
Mrs. Frank. You know how young people like to feel that 
they have secrets. Peter’s room is the only place where they 
can talk.
Mrs. Van Daan. Talk! That’s not what they called it when I 
was young.
[Mrs. Van Daan goes off to the bathroom. Margot settles down to 
read her book. Mr. Frank puts his papers away and brings a chess 
game to the center table. He and Mrs. Frank start to play. In 
Peter’s room, Anne speaks to Peter, indignant, humiliated.]
Anne. Aren’t they awful? Aren’t they impossible? Treating us 
as if we were still in the nursery.
[She sits on the cot. Peter gets a bottle of pop and two glasses.]
Peter. Don’t let it bother you. It doesn’t bother me.
Anne. I suppose you can’t really blame them . . . they think 
back to what they were like at our age. They don’t realize how 
much more advanced we are . . . When you think what 
wonderful discussions we’ve had! . . . Oh, I forgot. I was 
going to bring you some more pictures.
Peter. Oh, these are fine, thanks.
Anne. Don’t you want some more? Miep just brought me 
some new ones.
Peter. Maybe later. [He gives her a glass of pop and, taking some 
for himself, sits down facing her.]

Anne. [Looking up at one of the photographs.] I remember when 
I got that . . . I won it. I bet Jopie that I could eat five ice-cream 
cones. We’d all been playing ping-pong . . . We used to have 
heavenly times . . . we’d finish up with ice cream at the 
Delphi, or the Oasis, where Jews were allowed . . . there’d 
always be a lot of boys . . . we’d laugh and joke . . . I’d like to 
go back to it for a few days or a week. But after that I know 
I’d be bored to death. I think more seriously about life now. I 
want to be a journalist . . . or something. I love to write. What 
do you want to do?
Peter. I thought I might go off some place . . . work on a farm 
or something . . . some job that doesn’t take much brains.
Anne. You shouldn’t talk that way. You’ve got the most awful 
inferiority complex.
Peter. I know I’m not smart.
Anne. That isn’t true. You’re much better than I am in dozens 
of things . . . arithmetic and algebra and . . . well, you’re a 
million times better than I am in algebra. [With sudden 
directness] You like Margot, don’t you? Right from the start 
you liked her, liked her much better than me.
Peter. [Uncomfortably] Oh, I don’t know.
[In the main room Mrs. Van Daan comes from the bathroom and 
goes over to the sink, polishing a coffee pot.]
Anne. It’s all right. Everyone feels that way. Margot’s so 
good. She’s sweet and bright and beautiful and I’m not.
Peter. I wouldn’t say that.
Anne. Oh, no, I’m not. I know that. I know quite well that I’m 
not a beauty. I never have been and never shall be.
Peter. I don’t agree at all. I think you’re pretty.
Anne. That’s not true!
Peter. And another thing. You’ve changed . . . from at first, 
I mean.
Anne. I have?
Peter. I used to think you were awful noisy.
Anne. And what do you think now, Peter? How have I 
changed?
Peter. Well . . . er . . . you’re . . . quieter.
[In his room Dussel takes his pajamas and toilet articles and goes 
into the bathroom to change.]
Anne. I’m glad you don’t just hate me.

Anne. I bet when you get out of here you’ll never think of 
me again.
Peter. That’s crazy.
Anne. When you get back with all of your friends, you’re 
going to say . . . now what did I ever see in that Mrs. Quack 
Quack.
Peter. I haven’t got any friends.
Anne. Oh, Peter, of course you have. Everyone has friends.
Peter. Not me. I don’t want any. I get along all right 
without them.
Anne. Does that mean you can get along without me? I think 
of myself as your friend.
Peter. No. If they were all like you, it’d be different.
[He takes the glasses and the bottle and puts them away. There is a 
second’s silence and then Anne speaks, hesitantly, shyly.]
Anne. Peter, did you ever kiss a girl?
Peter. Yes. Once.
Anne. [To cover her feelings] That picture’s crooked. [Peter goes 
over, straightening the photograph.] Was she pretty?
Peter. Huh?
Anne. The girl that you kissed.
Peter. I don’t know. I was blindfolded. [He comes back and sits 
down again.] It was at a party. One of those kissing games.
Anne. [Relieved] Oh. I don’t suppose that really counts, 
does it?
Peter. It didn’t with me.
Anne. I’ve been kissed twice. Once a man l’d never seen 
before kissed me on the cheek when he picked me up off the 
ice and I was crying. And the other was Mr. Koophuis, a 
friend of Father’s who kissed my hand. You wouldn’t say 
those counted, would you?
Peter. I wouldn’t say so.
Anne. I know almost for certain that Margot would never 
kiss anyone unless she was engaged to them. And I’m sure 
too that Mother never touched a man before Pim. But I don’t 
know . . . things are so different now . . . What do you think? 
Do you think a girl shouldn’t kiss anyone except if she’s 
engaged or something? It’s so hard to try to think what to do, 
when here we are with the whole world falling around our 
ears and you think . . . well . . . you don’t know what’s going 
to happen tomorrow and . . . What do you think?

Peter. I suppose it’d depend on the girl. Some girls, anything 
they do’s wrong. But others . . . well . . . it wouldn’t 
necessarily be wrong with them. [The carillon starts to strike 
nine o’clock.] I’ve always thought that when two people . . .
Anne. Nine o’clock. I have to go.
Peter. That’s right.
Anne. [Without moving] Good night.
[There is a second’s pause, then Peter gets up and moves toward 
the door.]
Peter. You won’t let them stop you coming?
Anne. No. [She rises and starts for the door.] Sometimes I might 
bring my diary. There are so many things in it that I want to 
talk over with you. There’s a lot about you.
Peter. What kind of things?
Anne. I wouldn’t want you to see some of it. I thought you 
were a nothing, just the way you thought about me.
Peter. Did you change your mind, the way I changed my 
mind about you?
Anne. Well . . . You’ll see . . .
[For a second Anne stands looking up at Peter, longing for him to 
kiss her. As he makes no move she turns away. Then suddenly 
Peter grabs her awkwardly in his arms, kissing her on the cheek. 
Anne walks out dazed. She stands for a minute, her back to the 
people in the main room. As she regains her poise she goes to her 
mother and father and Margot, silently kissing them. They 
murmur their good nights to her. As she is about to open her 
bedroom door, she catches sight of Mrs. Van Daan. She goes 
quickly to her, taking her face in her hands and kissing her first on 
one cheek and then on the other. Then she hurries off into her room. 
Mrs. Van Daan looks after her, and then looks over at Peter’s 
room. Her suspicions are confirmed.]
Mrs. Van Daan. [She knows.] Ah hah!

Anne’s Voice comes faintly at first and then with growing

NOTES
Mr. Dussel wishes now that Mouschi was here. Thursday, the 
twentieth of April, nineteen forty-four. Invasion fever is 
mounting every day. Miep tells us that people outside talk of 
nothing else. For myself, life has become much more 
pleasant. I often go to Peter’s room after supper. Oh, don’t 
think I’m in love, because I’m not. But it does make life more 
bearable to have someone with whom you can exchange 
views. No more tonight. P.S. . . . I must be honest. I must 
confess that I actually live for the next meeting. Is there 
anything lovelier than to sit under the skylight and feel the 
sun on your cheeks and have a darling boy in your arms? I 
admit now that I’m glad the Van Daans had a son and not a 
daughter. I’ve outgrown another dress. That’s the third. I’m 
having to wear Margot’s clothes after all. I’m working hard 
on my French and am now reading La Belle Nivernaise.

Scene 3
[It is night, a few weeks later. Everyone is in bed. There is complete 
quiet. In the Van Daans’ room a match flares up for a moment and 
then is quickly put out. Mr. Van Daan, in bare feet, dressed in 
underwear and trousers, is dimly seen coming stealthily down the 
stairs and into the main room, where Mr. and Mrs. Frank and 
Margot are sleeping. He goes to the food safe and again lights a 
match. Then he cautiously opens the safe, taking out a half-loaf of 
bread. As he closes the safe, it creaks. He stands rigid. Mrs. Frank 
sits up in bed. She sees him.]

struggling men.]

the end of a loaf of bread that he has taken from Van Daan.]

Dussel. It was you, and all the time we thought it was 
the rats!
Mr. Frank. Mr. Van Daan, how could you!
Mr. Van Daan. I’m hungry.
Mrs. Frank. We’re all of us hungry! I see the children getting 
thinner and thinner. Your own son Peter . . . I’ve heard him 
moan in his sleep, he’s so hungry. And you come in the night 
and steal food that should go to them . . . to the children!

more food than the rest of us. He’s used to more. He’s a

Mrs. Frank. Just that! Take your things 
and get out!
Mr. Frank. [To Mrs. Frank] You’re 
speaking in anger. You cannot mean what 
you are saying.
Mrs. Frank. I mean exactly that!
[Mrs. Van Daan takes a cover from the 
Franks’ bed, pulling it about her.]
Mr. Frank. For two long years we have 
lived here, side by side. We have respected 
each other’s rights . . . we have managed 
to live in peace. Are we now going to 
throw it all away? I know this will never 
happen again, will it, Mr. Van Daan?
Mr. Van Daan. No. No.
Mrs. Frank. He steals once! He’ll steal 
again!
[Mr. Van Daan, holding his stomach, starts for the bathroom. 
Anne puts her arms around him, helping him up the step.]
Mr. Frank. Edith, please. Let us be calm. We’ll all go to our 
rooms . . . and afterwards we’ll sit down quietly and talk this 
out . . . we’ll find some way . . .
Mrs. Frank. No! No! No more talk! I want them to leave!
Mrs. Van Daan. You’d put us out, on the streets?
Mrs. Frank. There are other hiding places.
Mrs. Van Daan. A cellar . . . a closet. I know. And we have no 
money left even to pay for that.
Mrs. Frank. I’ll give you money. Out of my own pocket I’ll 
give it gladly. [She gets her purse from a shelf and comes back 
with it.]
Mrs. Van Daan. Mr. Frank, you told Putti you’d never forget 
what he’d done for you when you came to Amsterdam. You 
said you could never repay him, that you . . .
Mrs. Frank. [Counting out money.] If my husband had any 
obligation to you, he’s paid it, over and over.
Mr. Frank. Edith, I’ve never seen you like this before. I don’t 
know you.
Mrs. Frank. I should have spoken out long ago.
Dussel. You can’t be nice to some people.

Mrs. Van Daan. [Turning on Dussel] There would have been 
plenty for all of us, if you hadn’t come in here!
Mr. Frank. We don’t need the Nazis to destroy us. We’re 
destroying ourselves.
[He sits down, with his head in his hands. Mrs. Frank goes to 
Mrs. Van Daan.]
Mrs. Frank. [Giving Mrs. Van Daan some money] Give this to 
Miep. She’ll find you a place.
Anne. Mother, you’re not putting Peter out. Peter hasn’t done 
anything.
Mrs. Frank. He’ll stay, of course. When I say I must protect 
the children, I mean Peter too.
[Peter rises from the steps where he has been sitting.]
Peter. I’d have to go if Father goes.
[Mr. Van Daan comes from the bathroom. Mrs. Van Daan hurries 
to him and takes him to the couch. Then she gets water from the 
sink to bathe his face.]
Mrs. Frank. [While this is going on] He’s no father to you . . . 
that man! He doesn’t know what it is to be a father!
Peter. [Starting for his room] I wouldn’t feel right. I couldn’t 
stay.
Mrs. Frank. Very well, then. I’m sorry.
Anne. [Rushing over to Peter] No. Peter! No! [Peter goes into 
his room, closing the door after him. Anne turns back to her 
mother, crying.] I don’t care about the food. They can have 
mine! I don’t want it! Only don’t send them away. It’ll be 
daylight soon. They’ll be caught . . .
Margot. [Putting her arms comfortingly around Anne] Please, 
Mother!
Mrs. Frank. They’re not going now. They’ll stay here until 
Miep finds them a place. [To Mrs. Van Daan] But one thing I 
insist on! He must never come down here again! He must 
never come to this room where the food is stored! We’ll 
divide what we have . . . an equal share for each! [Dussel 
hurries over to get a sack of potatoes from the food safe. Mrs. Frank 
goes on, to Mrs. Van Daan] You can cook it here and take it up 
to him.
[Dussel brings the sack of potatoes back to the center table.]
Margot. Oh, no. No. We haven’t sunk so far that we’re going 
to fight over a handful of rotten potatoes.

Margot. Stop it! Stop it!
[We hear Miep’s excited voice speaking to  Mr. Frank below.]
Miep. Mr. Frank . . . the most wonderful news! . . . The 
invasion has begun!
Mr. Frank. Go on, tell them! Tell them!
[Miep comes running up the steps ahead of Mr. Frank. She has a 
man’s raincoat on over her nightclothes and a bunch of orange-
colored flowers in her hand.]
Miep. Did you hear that, everybody? Did you hear what I 
said? The invasion has begun! The invasion!
[They all stare at Miep, unable to grasp what she is telling them. 
Peter is the first to recover his wits.]
Peter. Where?
Mrs. Van Daan. When? When, Miep?
Miep. It began early this morning . . .
[As she talks on, the realization of what she has said begins to dawn 
on them. Everyone goes crazy. A wild demonstration takes place. 
Mrs. Frank hugs Mr. Van Daan.]

[Dussel embraces Mrs. Van Daan. Peter grabs a frying pan and 
parades around the room, beating on it, singing the Dutch National 
Anthem. Anne and Margot follow him, singing, weaving in and 
out among the excited grown-ups. Margot breaks away to take the 
flowers from Miep and distribute them to everyone. While this 
pandemonium is going on Mrs. Frank tries to make herself heard 
above the excitement.]
Mrs. Frank. [To Miep] How do you know? 
Miep. The radio . . . The B.B.C.! 9 They said they landed on 
the coast of Normandy!
Peter. The British?
Miep. British, Americans, French, Dutch, Poles, 
Norwegians . . . all of them! More than four thousand ships! 
Churchill spoke, and General Eisenhower! D-Day they call it!
Mr. Frank. Thank God, it’s come!
Mrs. Van Daan. At last!
Miep. [Starting out] I’m going to tell Mr. Kraler. This’ll be 
better than any blood transfusion.
Mr. Frank. [Stopping her] What part of Normandy did they 
land, did they say?
Miep. Normandy . . . that’s all I know now . . . I’ll be up the 
minute I hear some more! [She goes hurriedly out.]
Mr. Frank. [To Mrs. Frank] What did I tell you? What did 
I tell you?
[Mr. Frank indicates that he has forgotten to bolt the door after 
Miep. He hurries down the steps. Mr. Van Daan, sitting on the 
couch, suddenly breaks into a convulsive10 sob. Everybody looks at 
him, bewildered.]
Mrs. Van Daan. [Hurrying to him] Putti! Putti! What is it? 
What happened?
Mr. Van Daan. Please, I’m so ashamed.
[Mr. Frank comes back up the steps.]
Dussel. Oh, for God’s sake!
Mrs. Van Daan. Don’t, Putti.
Margot. It doesn’t matter now!
Mr. Frank. [Going to Mr. Van Daan] Didn’t you hear what 
Miep said? The invasion has come! We’re going to be 
liberated! This is a time to celebrate! [He embraces Mrs. Frank 
and then hurries to the cupboard and gets the cognac and a glass.]
Mr. Van Daan. To steal bread from children!

Mrs. Frank. We’ve all done things that we’re ashamed of.
Anne. Look at me, the way I’ve treated Mother . . . so mean 
and horrid to her.
Mrs. Frank. No, Anneke, no.
[Anne runs to her mother, putting her arms around her.]
Anne. Oh, Mother, I was. I was awful.
Mr. Van Daan. Not like me. No one is as bad as me!
Dussel. [To Mr. Van Daan] Stop it now! Let’s be happy!
Mr. Frank. [Giving Mr. Van Daan a glass of cognac] Here! Here! 
Schnapps! L’chaim!11
[Van Daan takes the cognac. They all watch him. He gives them a 
feeble smile. Anne puts up her fingers in a V-for-Victory sign. As 
Van Daan gives an answering V-sign, they are startled to hear a 
loud sob from behind them. It is Mrs. Frank, stricken with remorse. 
She is sitting on the other side of the room.]
Mrs. Frank. [Through her sobs] When I think of the terrible 
things I said . . .
[Mr. Frank, Anne and Margot hurry to her, trying to comfort her. 
Mr. Van Daan brings her his glass of cognac.] 
Mr. Van Daan. No! No! You were right!
Mrs. Frank. That I should speak that way to you! . . . Our 
friends! . . . Our guests! [She starts to cry again.]
Dussel. Stop it, you’re spoiling the whole invasion!
[As they are comforting her, the lights dim out. The curtain falls.]
Anne’s Voice. [Faintly at first and then with growing strength] 
We’re all in much better spirits these days. There’s still 
excellent news of the invasion. The best part about it is that I 
have a feeling that friends are coming. Who knows? Maybe 
I’ll be back in school by fall. Ha, ha! The joke is on us! The 
warehouse man doesn’t know a thing and we are paying him 
all that money! . . . Wednesday, the second of July, nineteen 
forty-four. The invasion seems temporarily to be bogged 
down. Mr. Kraler has to have an operation, which looks bad. 
The Gestapo have found the radio that was stolen. Mr. Dussel 
says they’ll trace it back and back to the thief, and then, it’s 
just a matter of time till they get to us. Everyone is low. Even 
poor Pim can’t raise their spirits. I have often been downcast 
myself . . . but never in despair. I can shake off everything if I 
write. But . . . and that is the great question . . . will I ever be 
able to write well? I want to so much. I want to go on living 
even after my death. Another birthday has gone by, so now I

Scene 4
[It is an afternoon a few weeks later . . . Everyone but Margot is in 
the main room. There is a sense of great tension. 
Both Mrs. Frank and Mr. Van Daan are nervously pacing back 
and forth, Dussel is standing at the window, looking down fixedly 
at the street below. Peter is at the center table, trying to do his 
lessons. Anne sits opposite him, writing in her diary. Mrs. Van 
Daan is seated on the couch, her eyes on Mr. Frank as he sits 
reading.
The sound of a telephone ringing comes from the office below. They 
all are rigid, listening tensely. Dussel rushes down to Mr. Frank.]
Dussel. There it goes again, the telephone! Mr. Frank, do 
you hear?
Mr. Frank. [Quietly] Yes. I hear.
Dussel. [Pleading, insistent] But this is the third time, Mr. 
Frank! The third time in quick succession! It’s a signal! I tell 
you it’s Miep, trying to get us! For some reason she can’t 
come to us and she’s trying to warn us of something!
Mr. Frank. Please. Please.
Mr. Van Daan. [To Dussel] You’re wasting your breath.
Dussel. Something has happened, Mr. Frank. For three days 
now Miep hasn’t been to see us! And today not a man has 
come to work. There hasn’t been a sound in the building!
Mrs. Frank. Perhaps it’s Sunday. We may have lost track of 
the days.
Mr. Van Daan. [To Anne] You with the diary there. What 
day is it?
Dussel. [Going to Mrs. Frank] I don’t lose track of the days! 
I know exactly what day it is! It’s Friday, the fourth of 
August. Friday, and not a man at work. [He rushes back to 
Mr. Frank. Pleading with him, almost in tears.] I tell you 
Mr. Kraler’s dead. That’s the only explanation. He’s dead 
and they’ve closed down the building, and Miep’s trying to 
tell us!

Mr. Frank. She’d never telephone us.
Dussel. [Frantic] Mr. Frank, answer that! I beg you, answer it!
Mr. Frank. No.
Mr. Van Daan. Just pick it up and listen. You don’t have to 
speak. Just listen and see if it’s Miep.
Dussel. [Speaking at the same time] For God’s sake . . . I ask 
you.
Mr. Frank. No. I’ve told you, no. I’ll do nothing that might let 
anyone know we’re in the building.
Peter. Mr. Frank’s right.
Mr. Van Daan. There’s no need to tell us what side you’re on.
Mr. Frank. If we wait patiently, quietly, I believe that help 
will come.
[There is silence for a minute as they all listen to the telephone 
ringing.]
Dussel. I’m going down. [He rushes down the steps. Mr. Frank 
tries ineffectually to hold him. Dussel runs to the lower door, 
unbolting it. The telephone stops ringing. Dussel bolts the door 
and comes slowly back up the steps.] Too late. [Mr. Frank goes to 
Margot in Anne’s bedroom.]
Mr. Van Daan. So we just wait here until we die.
Mrs. Van Daan. [Hysterically] I can’t stand it! I’ll kill myself! 
I’ll kill myself!
Mr. Van Daan. For God’s sake, stop it!
[In the distance, a German military band is heard playing a 
Viennese waltz.]
Mrs. Van Daan. I think you’d be glad if I did! I think you 
want me to die!
Mr. Van Daan. Whose fault is it we’re here? [Mrs. Van Daan 
starts for her room. He follows, talking at her.] We could’ve been 
safe somewhere . . . in America or Switzerland. But no! No! 
You wouldn’t leave when I wanted to. You couldn’t leave 
your things. You couldn’t leave your precious furniture.
Mrs. Van Daan. Don’t touch me!
[She hurries up the stairs, followed by Mr. Van Daan. Peter, 
unable to bear it, goes to his room. Anne looks after him, deeply 
concerned. Dussel returns to his post at the window. Mr. Frank 
comes back into the main room and takes a book, trying to read. 
Mrs. Frank sits near the sink, starting to peel some potatoes. Anne 
quietly goes to Peter’s room closing the door after her. Peter is 
lying face down on the cot. Anne leans over him, holding him in 
her arms, trying to bring him out of his despair.]

Anne. Look, Peter, the sky. [She looks up through the skylight.] 
What a lovely, lovely day! Aren’t the clouds beautiful? You 
know what I do when it seems as if I couldn’t stand being 
cooped up for one more minute? I think myself out. I think 
myself on a walk in the park where I used to go with Pim. 
Where the jonquils and the crocus and the violets grow down 
the slopes. You know the most wonderful part about thinking 
yourself out? You can have it any way you like. You can have 
roses and violets and chrysanthemums all blooming at the 
same time . . . It’s funny . . . I used to take it all for granted . . . 
and now I’ve gone crazy about everything to do with nature. 
Haven’t you?
Peter. I’ve just gone crazy. I think if something doesn’t 
happen soon . . . if we don’t get out of here . . . I can’t stand 
much more of it!
Anne. [Softly] I wish you had a religion, Peter.
Peter. No, thanks! Not me!
Anne. Oh, I don’t mean you have to be Orthodox12 . . . or 
believe in heaven and hell and purgatory13 and things . . . I 
just mean some religion . . . it doesn’t matter what. Just to 
believe in something! When I think of all that’s out there . . . 
the trees . . . and flowers . . . and seagulls . . . when I think of 
the dearness of you, Peter . . . and the goodness of the people 
we know . . . Mr. Kraler, Miep, Dirk, the vegetable man, all 
risking their lives for us every day. . . When I think of these 
good things, I’m not afraid any more . . . I find myself, and 
God, and I . . .
[Peter interrupts, getting up and walking away.]
Peter. That’s fine! But when I begin to think, I get mad! Look 
at us, hiding out for two years. Not able to move! Caught 
here like . . . waiting for them to come and get us . . . and all 
for what?
Anne. We’re not the only people that’ve had to suffer. 
There’ve always been people that’ve had to . . . sometimes 
one race . . . sometimes another . . . and yet . . .
Peter. That doesn’t make me feel any better!
Anne. [Going to him] I know it’s terrible, trying to have any 
faith . . . when people are doing such horrible . . . But you 
know what I sometimes think? I think the world may be 
going through a phase, the way I was with Mother. It’ll pass, 
maybe not for hundreds of years, but some day . . . I still 
believe, in spite of everything, that people are really good at 
heart.

Peter. I want to see something now . . . Not a thousand years 
from now! [He goes over, sitting down again on the cot.]
Anne. But, Peter, if you’d only look at it as part of a great 
pattern . . . that we’re just a little minute in the life . . . [She 
breaks off.] Listen to us, going at each other like a couple of 
stupid grownups! Look at the sky now. Isn’t it lovely? [She 
holds out her hand to him. Peter takes it and rises, standing with 
her at the window looking out, his arms around her.] Some day, 
when we’re outside again, I’m going to . . . 
[She breaks off as she hears the sound of a car, its brakes squealing 
as it comes to a sudden stop. The people in the other rooms also 
become aware of the sound. They listen tensely. Another car roars 
up to a screeching stop. Anne and Peter come from Peter’s room. 
Mr. and Mrs. Van Daan creep down the stairs. Dussel comes out 
from his room. Everyone is listening, hardly breathing. A doorbell 
clangs again and again in the building below. Mr. Frank starts 
quietly down the steps to the door. Dussel and Peter follow him. 
The others stand rigid, waiting, terrified.
In a few seconds Dussel comes stumbling back up the steps. He 
shakes off Peter’s help and goes to his room. Mr. Frank bolts the 
door below, and comes slowly back up the steps. Their eyes are all 
on him as he stands there for a minute. They realize that what they 
feared has happened. Mrs. Van Daan starts to whimper. Mr. Van 
Daan puts her gently in a chair; and then hurries off up the stairs 
to their room to collect their things. Peter goes to comfort his 
mother. There is a sound of violent pounding on a door below.]
Mr. Frank. [Quietly] For the past two years we have lived in 
fear. Now we can live in hope.
[The pounding below becomes more insistent. There are muffled 
sounds of voices, shouting commands.]
Men’s Voices. Auf machen! Da drinnen! Auf machen! Schnell! 
Schnell! Schnell!14 etc., etc.
[The street door below is forced open. We hear the heavy tread of 
footsteps coming up. Mr. Frank gets two school bags from the 
shelves, and gives one to Anne and the other to Margot. He goes to 
get a bag for Mrs. Frank. The sound of feet coming up grows 
louder. Peter comes to Anne, kissing her good-bye, then he goes to 
his room to collect his things. The buzzer of their door starts to 
ring. Mr. Frank brings Mrs. Frank a bag. They stand together, 
waiting. We hear the thud of gun butts on the door, trying to break 
it down.

Anne stands, holding her school satchel, looking over at her father 
and mother with a soft, reassuring smile. She is no longer a child, 
but a woman with courage to meet whatever lies ahead.
The lights dim out. The curtain falls on the scene. We hear a mighty 
crash as the door is shattered. After a second Anne’s Voice is 
heard.]
Anne’s Voice. And so it seems our stay here is over. They are 
waiting for us now. They’ve allowed us five minutes to get 
our things. We can each take a bag and whatever it will hold 
of clothing. Nothing else. So, dear Diary, that means I must 
leave you behind. Good-bye for a while. P.S. Please, please, 
Miep, or Mr. Kraler, or anyone else. If you should find this 
diary, will you please keep it safe for me, because some day I 
hope . . .

Scene 5
[It is again the afternoon in November, 1945. The rooms are as we 
saw them in the first scene. Mr. Kraler has joined Miep and 
Mr. Frank. There are coffee cups on the table. We see a great change 
in Mr. Frank. He is calm now. His bitterness is gone. He slowly 
turns a few pages of the diary. They are blank.]
Mr. Frank. No more. [He closes the diary and puts it down on the 
couch beside him.]
Miep. I’d gone to the country to find food. When I got back 
the block was surrounded by police . . .
Mr. Kraler. We made it our business to learn how they knew. 
It was the thief . . . the thief who told them.
[Miep goes up to the gas burner, bringing back a pot of coffee.]
Mr. Frank. [After a pause] It seems strange to say this, that 
anyone could be happy in a concentration camp. But Anne 
was happy in the camp in Holland where they first took us. 
After two years of being shut up in these rooms, she could be 
out . . . out in the sunshine and the fresh air that she loved.
Miep. [Offering the coffee to Mr. Frank] A little more?
Mr. Frank. [Holding out his cup to her] The news of the war 
was good. The British and Americans were sweeping through 
France. We felt sure that they would get to us in time. In

BACKGROUND
Anne Frank was a young Jewish girl living in Amsterdam during 
the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands in World War II. Fearing for 
their lives, the Frank family was forced into hiding. The diary that 
Anne kept during their time in hiding is one of the most famous 
and heartbreaking pieces of literature from the Holocaust. Anne’s 
diary gained recognition both for its historical significance and for 
her incredible talent as a writer and storyteller. Tragically, Anne died 
in a concentration camp just weeks before it was liberated by British 
soldiers. The play you will read was based on her life and diary.

Act I
Scene 1
 [The scene remains the same throughout the play. It is the top floor 
of a warehouse and office building in Amsterdam, Holland. The 
sharply peaked roof of the building is outlined against a sea of other 
rooftops, stretching away into the distance. Nearby is the belfry of a 
church tower, the Westertoren, whose carillon1 rings out the hours. 
Occasionally faint sounds float up from below: the voices of 
children playing in the street, the tramp of marching feet, a boat 
whistle from the canal.
The three rooms of the top floor and a small attic space above are 
exposed to our view. The largest of the rooms is in the center, with 
two small rooms, slightly raised, on either side. On the right is a 
bathroom, out of sight. A narrow steep flight of stairs at the back 
leads up to the attic. The rooms are sparsely furnished with a few 
chairs, cots, a table or two. The windows are painted over, or 
covered with makeshift blackout curtains.2 In the main room there is 
a sink, a gas ring for cooking and a woodburning stove for warmth.
The room on the left is hardly more than a closet. There is a skylight 
in the sloping ceiling. Directly under this room is a small steep 
stairwell, with steps leading down to a door. This is the only entrance 
from the building below. When the door is opened we see that it has 
been concealed on the outer side by a bookcase attached to it.
The curtain rises on an empty stage. It is late afternoon, 
November 1945.
The rooms are dusty, the curtains in rags. Chairs and tables are 
overturned.
The door at the foot of the small stairwell swings open. Mr. Frank 
comes up the steps into view. He is a gentle, cultured European in his 
middle years. There is still a trace of a German accent in his speech.
He stands looking slowly around, making a supreme effort at 
self-control. He is weak, ill. His clothes are threadbare.
After a second he drops his rucksack on the couch and moves slowly 
about. He opens the door to one of the smaller rooms, and then 
abruptly closes it again, turning away. He goes to the window at 
the back, looking off at the Westertoren as its carillon strikes the 
hour of six, then he moves restlessly on.
From the street below we hear the sound of a barrel organ3 and 
children’s voices at play. There is a many-colored scarf hanging 
from a nail. Mr. Frank takes it, putting it around his neck. As he 
starts back for his rucksack, his eye is caught by something lying on 
the floor. It is a woman’s white glove. He holds it in his hand and 
suddenly all of his self-control is gone. He breaks down, crying.

NOTES
We hear footsteps on the stairs. Miep Gies comes up, looking for 
Mr. Frank. Miep is a Dutch girl of about twenty-two. She wears a 
coat and hat, ready to go home. She is pregnant. Her attitude 
toward Mr. Frank is protective, compassionate.]
Miep. Are you all right, Mr. Frank?
Mr. Frank. [Quickly controlling himself] Yes, Miep, yes.
Miep. Everyone in the office has gone home . . . It’s after six. 
[Then pleading] Don’t stay up here, Mr. Frank. What’s the use 
of torturing yourself like this?
Mr. Frank. I’ve come to say good-bye . . . I’m leaving here, 
Miep.
Miep. What do you mean? Where are you going? Where?
Mr. Frank. I don’t know yet. I haven’t decided.
Miep. Mr. Frank, you can’t leave here! This is your home! 
Amsterdam is your home. Your business is here, waiting for 
you . . . You’re needed here . . . Now that the war is over, 
there are things that . . .
Mr. Frank. I can’t stay in Amsterdam, Miep. It has too many 
memories for me. Everywhere there’s something . . . the 
house we lived in . . . the school . . . that street organ playing 
out there . . . I’m not the person you used to know, Miep. I’m 
a bitter old man. [Breaking off] Forgive me. I shouldn’t speak 
to you like this . . . after all that you did for us . . . the 
suffering . . .
Miep. No. No. It wasn’t suffering. You can’t say we suffered. 
[As she speaks, she straightens a chair which is overturned.]
Mr. Frank. I know what you went through, you and Mr. 
Kraler. I’ll remember it as long as I live. [He gives one last look 
around.] Come, Miep. [He starts for the steps, then remembers his 
rucksack, going back to get it.]
Miep. [Hurrying up to a cupboard] Mr. Frank, did you see? 
There are some of your papers here. [She brings a bundle of 
papers to him.] We found them in a heap of rubbish on the 
floor after . . . after you left.
Mr. Frank. Burn them. [He opens his rucksack to put the glove in it.]
Miep. But, Mr. Frank, there are letters, notes . . .
Mr. Frank. Burn them. All of them.
Miep. Burn this? [She hands him a paperbound notebook.]

on the couch.] “Dear Diary, since you and I are going to be 
great friends, I will start by telling you about myself. My 
name is Anne Frank. I am thirteen years old. I was born in 
Germany the twelfth of June, nineteen twenty-nine. As my 
family is Jewish, we emigrated to Holland when Hitler came 
to power.”
[As Mr. Frank reads on, another voice joins his, as if coming from 
the air. It is Anne’s Voice.]
Mr. Frank and Anne. “My father started a business, 
importing spice and herbs. Things went well for us until 
nineteen forty. Then the war came, and the Dutch 
capitulation,4 followed by the arrival of the Germans. Then 
things got very bad for the Jews.”
[Mr. Frank’s Voice dies out. Anne’s Voice continues alone. The 
lights dim slowly to darkness. The curtain falls on the scene.]
Anne’s Voice. You could not do this and you could not do 
that. They forced Father out of his business. We had to wear 
yellow stars.5 I had to turn in my bike. I couldn’t go to a 
Dutch school any more. I couldn’t go to the movies, or ride in 
an automobile, or even on a streetcar, and a million other 
things. But somehow we children still managed to have fun. 
Yesterday Father told me we were going into hiding. Where, 
he wouldn’t say. At five o’clock this morning Mother woke 
me and told me to hurry and get dressed. I was to put on as 
many clothes as I could. It would look too suspicious if we 
walked along carrying suitcases. It wasn’t until we were on 
our way that I learned where we were going. Our hiding 
place was to be upstairs in the building where Father used to 
have his business. Three other people were coming in with 
us . . . the Van Daans and their son Peter . . . Father knew the 
Van Daans but we had never met them . . .
[During the last lines the curtain rises on the scene. The lights dim 
on. Anne’s Voice fades out.]

sixteen. He wears a cap, a raincoat, and long Dutch trousers, like 
“plus fours.”7 At his feet is a black case, a carrier for his cat.

pregnant now) and Mr. Kraler. All of them carry bags, packages, 
and so forth. The Star of David is conspicuous on all of the Franks’ 
clothing. Margot is eighteen, beautiful, quiet, shy. Mrs. Frank is a 
young mother, gently bred, reserved. She, like Mr. Frank, has a 
slight German accent. Mr. Kraler is a Dutchman, dependable, 
kindly.
As Mr. Kraler and Miep go upstage to put down their parcels, 
Mrs. Frank turns back to call Anne.]

brought on the shelves.]
Mr. Kraler. I’m sorry there is still so much confusion.

Mr. Van Daan. It’s a wonder we weren’t arrested, walking 
along the streets . . . Petronella with a fur coat in July . . . and 
that cat of Peter’s crying all the way.
Anne. [As she is removing a pair of panties] A cat?
Mrs. Frank. [Shocked] Anne, please!
Anne. It’s alright. I’ve got on three more.
[She pulls off two more. Finally, as they have all removed their 
surplus clothes, they look to Mr. Frank, waiting for him to speak.]
Mr. Frank. Now. About the noise. While the men are in the 
building below, we must have complete quiet. Every sound 
can be heard down there, not only in the workrooms, but in 
the offices too. The men come at about eight-thirty, and leave 
at about five-thirty. So, to be perfectly safe, from eight in the 
morning until six in the evening we must move only when it 
is necessary, and then in stockinged feet. We must not speak 
above a whisper. We must not run any water. We cannot use 
the sink, or even, forgive me, the w.c.12 The pipes go down 
through the workrooms. It would be heard. No trash . . .
[Mr. Frank stops abruptly as he hears the sound of marching feet 
from the street below. Everyone is motionless, paralyzed with fear. 
Mr. Frank goes quietly into the room on the right to look down out 
of the window. Anne runs after him, peering out with him. The 
tramping feet pass without stopping. The tension is relieved. 
Mr. Frank, followed by Anne, returns to the main room and 
resumes his instructions to the group.] . . . No trash must ever be 
thrown out which might reveal that someone is living up 
here . . . not even a potato paring. We must burn everything 
in the stove at night. This is the way we must live until it is 
over, if we are to survive.
[There is silence for a second.]
Mrs. Frank. Until it is over.
Mr. Frank. [Reassuringly] After six we can move about . . . we 
can talk and laugh and have our supper and read and play 
games . . . just as we would at home. [He looks at his watch.] 
And now I think it would be wise if we all went to our 
rooms, and were settled before eight o’clock. Mrs. Van Daan, 
you and your husband will be upstairs. I regret that there’s 
no place up there for Peter. But he will be here, near us. This 
will be our common room, where we’ll meet to talk and eat 
and read, like one family.

NOTES
[Mrs. Frank goes to join Mr. Frank and Margot.]
[During the following scene Mr. Frank helps 
Margot and Mrs. Frank to hang up their clothes. 
Then he persuades them both to lie down and rest. 
The Van Daans in their room above settle 
themselves. In the main room Anne and Peter 
remove their shoes. Peter takes his cat out of the 
carrier.]
Anne. What’s your cat’s name?
Peter. Mouschi.
Anne. Mouschi! Mouschi! Mouschi! [She picks 
up the cat, walking away with it. To Peter] I love 
cats. I have one . . . a darling little cat. But they 
made me leave her behind. I left some food and 
a note for the neighbors to take care of her . . . 
I’m going to miss her terribly. What is yours? A 
him or a her?
Peter. He’s a tom. He doesn’t like strangers. [He 
takes the cat from her, putting it back in its carrier.]
Anne. [Unabashed] Then I’ll have to stop being a 
stranger, won’t I? Is he fixed?

Jews were regularly rounded up and forced 
to leave their homes without notice. 
Peter. [Startled] Huh?
Anne. Did you have him fixed?
Peter. No.
Anne. Oh, you ought to have him fixed—to keep him from—
you know, fighting. Where did you go to school?
Peter. Jewish Secondary.
Anne. But that’s where Margot and I go! I never saw you 
around. 
Peter. I used to see you . . . sometimes . . .
Anne. You did?
Peter. . . . In the school yard. You were always in the middle 
of a bunch of kids. [He takes a penknife from his pocket.]
Anne. Why didn’t you ever come over?
Peter. I’m sort of a lone wolf. [He starts to rip off his Star of 
David.]
Anne. What are you doing?
Peter. Taking it off.
Anne. But you can’t do that. They’ll arrest you if you go out 
without your star.
[He tosses his knife on the table.]

Peter. Who’s going out?
Anne. Why, of course! You’re right! Of course we don’t need 
them any more. [She picks up his knife and starts to take her star 
off.] I wonder what our friends will think when we don’t 
show up today?
Peter. I didn’t have any dates with anyone.
Anne. Oh, I did. I had a date with Jopie to go and play ping-
pong at her house. Do you know Jopie de Waal?
Peter. No.
Anne. Jopie’s my best friend. I wonder what she’ll think 
when she telephones and there’s no answer? . . . Probably 
she’ll go over to the house . . . I wonder what she’ll think . . . 
we left everything as if we’d suddenly been called away . . . 
breakfast dishes in the sink . . . beds not made . . . [As she pulls 
off her star, the cloth underneath shows clearly the color and form of 
the star.] Look! It’s still there! [Peter goes over to the stove with 
his star.] What’re you going to do with yours?
Peter. Burn it.
Anne. [She starts to throw hers in, and cannot.] It’s funny, I can’t 
throw mine away. I don’t know why.
Peter. You can’t throw . . . ? Something they branded you 
with . . . ? That they made you wear so they could spit on 
you? 
Anne. I know. I know. But after all, it is the Star of David, 
isn’t it?
[In the bedroom, right, Margot and Mrs. Frank are lying down. 
Mr. Frank starts quietly out.]
Peter. Maybe it’s different for a girl.
[Mr. Frank comes into the main room.]
Mr. Frank. Forgive me, Peter. Now let me see. We must 
find a bed for your cat. [He goes to a cupboard.] I’m glad you 
brought your cat. Anne was feeling so badly about hers. 
[Getting a used small washtub] Here we are. Will it be 
comfortable in that?
Peter. [Gathering up his things] Thanks.
Mr. Frank. [Opening the door of the room on the left] And here is 
your room. But I warn you, Peter, you can’t grow any more. 
Not an inch, or you’ll have to sleep with your feet out of the 
skylight. Are you hungry?
Peter. No.
Mr. Frank. We have some bread and butter.

Peter. No, thank you. 
Mr. Frank. You can have it for luncheon then. And tonight 
we will have a real supper . . . our first supper together.
Peter. Thanks. Thanks. [He goes into his room. During the 
following scene he arranges his possessions in his new room.]
Mr. Frank. That’s a nice boy, Peter.
Anne. He’s awfully shy, isn’t he?
Mr. Frank. You’ll like him, I know.
Anne. I certainly hope so, since he’s the only boy I’m likely to 
see for months and months.
[Mr. Frank sits down, taking off his shoes.]
Mr. Frank. Annele,14 there’s a box there. Will you open it?
[He indicates a carton on the couch. Anne brings it to the center 
table. In the street below there is the sound of children playing.]
Anne. [As she opens the carton] You know the way I’m going to 
think of it here? I’m going to think of it as a boarding house. 
A very peculiar summer boarding house, like the one that 
we—[She breaks off as she pulls out some photographs.] Father! 
My movie stars! I was wondering where they were! I was 
looking for them this morning . . . and Queen Wilhelmina!15 
How wonderful!
Mr. Frank. There’s something more. Go on. Look further. [He 
goes over to the sink, pouring a glass of milk from a thermos bottle.]
Anne. [Pulling out a pasteboard-bound book] A diary! [She 
throws her arms around her father.] I’ve never had a diary. And 
I’ve always longed for one. [She looks around the room.] Pencil, 
pencil, pencil, pencil. [She starts down the stairs.] I’m going 
down to the office to get a pencil.
Mr. Frank. Anne! No! [He goes after her, catching her by the arm 
and pulling her back.]
Anne. [Startled] But there’s no one in the building now.
Mr. Frank. It doesn’t matter. I don’t want you ever to go 
beyond that door.
Anne. [Sobered] Never . . . ? Not even at nighttime, when 
everyone is gone? Or on Sundays? Can’t I go down to listen 
to the radio?
Mr. Frank. Never. I am sorry, Anneke.16 It isn’t safe. No, you 
must never go beyond that door.
[For the first time Anne realizes what “going into hiding” means.]
Anne. I see.

NOTES
Mr. Frank. It’ll be hard, I know. But always remember this, 
Anneke. There are no walls, there are no bolts, no locks that 
anyone can put on your mind. Miep will bring us books. We 
will read history, poetry, mythology. [He gives her the glass of 
milk.] Here’s your milk. [With his arm about her, they go over to 
the couch, sitting down side by side.] As a matter of fact, 
between us, Anne, being here has certain advantages for you. 
For instance, you remember the battle you had with your 
mother the other day on the subject of overshoes? You said 
you’d rather die than wear overshoes? But in the end you 
had to wear them? Well now, you see, for as long as we are 
here you will never have to wear overshoes! Isn’t that good? 
And the coat that you inherited from Margot, you won’t have 
to wear that any more. And the piano! You won’t have to 
practice on the piano. I tell you, this is going to be a fine life 
for you!
[Anne’s panic is gone. Peter appears in the doorway of his room, 
with a saucer in his hand. He is carrying his cat.]
Peter. I . . . I . . . I thought I’d better get some water for 
Mouschi before . . .
Mr. Frank. Of course.
[As he starts toward the sink the carillon begins to chime the hour 
of eight. He tiptoes to the window at the back and looks down at the 
street below. He turns to Peter, indicating in pantomime that it is 
too late. Peter starts back for his room. He steps on a creaking 
board. The three of them are frozen for a minute in fear. As Peter 
starts away again, Anne tiptoes over to him and pours some of the 
milk from her glass into the saucer for the cat. Peter squats on the 
floor, putting the milk before the cat. Mr. Frank gives Anne his 
fountain pen, and then goes into the room at the right. For a second 
Anne watches the cat, then she goes over to the center table, and 
opens her diary.
In the room at the right, Mrs. Frank has sat up quickly at the 
sound of the carillon. Mr. Frank comes in and sits down beside her 
on the settee, his arm comfortingly around her.
Upstairs, in the attic room, Mr. and Mrs. Van Daan have hung 
their clothes in the closet and are now seated on the iron bed. 
Mrs. Van Daan leans back exhausted. Mr. Van Daan fans her with 
a newspaper.
Anne starts to write in her diary. The lights dim out, the curtain 
falls.
In the darkness Anne’s Voice comes to us again, faintly at first, 
and then with growing strength.]

NOTES
Anne’s Voice. I expect I should be describing what it feels 
like to go into hiding. But I really don’t know yet myself. I 
only know it’s funny never to be able to go outdoors . . . 
never to breathe fresh air . . . never to run and shout and 
jump. It’s the silence in the nights that frightens me most. 
Every time I hear a creak in the house, or a step on the street 
outside, I’m sure they’re coming for us. The days aren’t so 
bad. At least we know that Miep and Mr. Kraler are down 
there below us in the office. Our protectors, we call them. I 
asked Father what would happen to them if the Nazis found 
out they were hiding us. Pim said that they would suffer the 
same fate that we would . . . Imagine! They know this, and 
yet when they come up here, they’re always cheerful and gay 
as if there were nothing in the world to bother them . . . 
Friday, the twenty-first of August, nineteen forty-two. Today 
I’m going to tell you our general news. Mother is unbearable. 
She insists on treating me like a baby, which I loathe. 
Otherwise things are going better. The weather is . . .
[As Anne’s Voice is fading out, the curtain rises on the scene.]

Scene 3
[It is a little after six o’clock in the evening, two months later. 
Margot is in the bedroom at the right, studying. Mr. Van Daan is 
lying down in the attic room above.
The rest of the “family” is in the main room. Anne and Peter sit 
opposite each other at the center table, where they have been doing 
their lessons. Mrs. Frank is on the couch. Mrs. Van Daan is seated 
with her fur coat, on which she has been sewing, in her lap. None of 
them are wearing their shoes.
Their eyes are on Mr. Frank, waiting for him to give them the 
signal which will release them from their day-long quiet. Mr. 
Frank, his shoes in his hand, stands looking down out of the 
window at the back, watching to be sure that all of the workmen 
have left the building below.
After a few seconds of motionless silence, Mr. Frank turns from the 
window.]
Mrs. Frank. [Quietly, to the group] It’s safe now. The last 
workman has left.
[There is an immediate stir of relief.] 
Anne. [Her pent-up energy explodes.] WHEE!

NOTES
Mr. Frank. [Startled, amused] Anne!
Mrs. Van Daan. I’m first for the w.c. 
[She hurries off to the bathroom. Mrs. Frank puts on her shoes and 
starts up to the sink to prepare supper. Anne sneaks Peter’s shoes 
from under the table and hides them behind her back. Mr. Frank 
goes in to Margot’s room.]
Mr. Frank. [To Margot] Six o’clock. School’s over.
[Margot gets up, stretching. Mr. Frank sits down to put on his 
shoes. In the main room Peter tries to find his.]
Peter. [To Anne] Have you seen my shoes?
Anne. [Innocently] Your shoes?
Peter. You’ve taken them, haven’t you?
Anne. I don’t know what you’re talking about.
Peter. You’re going to be sorry!
Anne. Am I?
[Peter goes after her. Anne, with his shoes in her hand, runs from 
him, dodging behind her mother.]
Mrs. Frank. [Protesting] Anne, dear!
Peter. Wait till I get you!
Anne. I’m waiting! [Peter makes a lunge for her. They both fall to 
the floor. Peter pins her down, wrestling with her to get the shoes.] 
Don’t! Don’t! Peter, stop it. Ouch!
Mrs. Frank. Anne! . . . Peter!
[Suddenly Peter becomes self-conscious. He grabs his shoes roughly 
and starts for his room.]
Anne. [Following him] Peter, where are you going? Come 
dance with me.
Peter. I tell you I don’t know how.
Anne. I’ll teach you.
Peter. I’m going to give Mouschi his dinner.
Anne. Can I watch?
Peter. He doesn’t like people around while he eats.
Anne. Peter, please.
Peter. No! [He goes into his room. Anne slams his door after him.]
Mrs. Frank. Anne, dear, I think you shouldn’t play like that 
with Peter. It’s not dignified.
Anne. Who cares if it’s dignified? I don’t want to be 
dignified.

[Mr. Frank and Margot come from the room on the right. Margot 
goes to help her mother. Mr. Frank starts for the center table to 
correct Margot’s school papers.]
Mrs. Frank. [To Anne] You complain that I don’t treat you 
like a grownup. But when I do, you resent it.
Anne. I only want some fun . . . someone to laugh and clown 
with . . . After you’ve sat still all day and hardly moved, 
you’ve got to have some fun. I don’t know what’s the matter 
with that boy.
Mr. Frank. He isn’t used to girls. Give him a little time.
Anne. Time? Isn’t two months time? I could cry. [Catching 
hold of Margot] Come on, Margot . . . dance with me. Come 
on, please.
Margot. I have to help with supper.
Anne. You know we’re going to forget how to dance . . . 
When we get out we won’t remember a thing.
[She starts to sing and dance by herself. Mr. Frank takes her in 
his arms, waltzing with her. Mrs. Van Daan comes in from the 
bathroom.]
Mrs. Van Daan. Next? [She looks around as she starts putting on 
her shoes.] Where’s Peter?
Anne. [As they are dancing] Where would he be!
Mrs. Van Daan. He hasn’t finished his lessons, has he? His 
father’ll kill him if he catches him in there with that cat and 
his work not done. [Mr. Frank and Anne finish their dance. 
They bow to each other with extravagant formality.] Anne, get 
him out of there, will you?
Anne. [At Peter’s door] Peter? Peter?
Peter. [Opening the door a crack] What is it?
Anne. Your mother says to come out.
Peter. I’m giving Mouschi his dinner.
Mrs. Van Daan. You know what your father says. [She sits on 
the couch, sewing on the lining of her fur coat.]
Peter. For heaven’s sake, I haven’t even looked at him since 
lunch.
Mrs. Van Daan. I’m just telling you, that’s all.
Anne. I’ll feed him.
Peter. I don’t want you in there.

Mrs. Van Daan. Peter!
Peter. [To Anne] Then give him his dinner and come right 
out, you hear?
[He comes back to the table. Anne shuts the door of Peter’s room 
after her and disappears behind the curtain covering his closet.]
Mrs. Van Daan. [To Peter] Now is that any way to talk to 
your little girl friend?
Peter. Mother . . . for heaven’s sake . . . will you please stop 
saying that?
Mrs. Van Daan. Look at him blush! Look at him!
Peter. Please! I’m not . . . anyway . . . let me alone, will you?
Mrs. Van Daan. He acts like it was something to be ashamed 
of. It’s nothing to be ashamed of, to have a little girl friend.
Peter. You’re crazy. She’s only thirteen.
Mrs. Van Daan. So what? And you’re sixteen. Just perfect. 
Your father’s ten years older than I am. [To Mr. Frank] I warn 
you, Mr. Frank, if this war lasts much longer, we’re going to 
be related and then . . .
Mr. Frank. Mazel tov!17
Mrs. Frank. [Deliberately changing the conversation] I wonder 
where Miep is. She’s usually so prompt. 
[Suddenly everything else is forgotten as they hear the sound of an 
automobile coming to a screeching stop in the street below. They are 
tense, motionless in their terror. The car starts away. A wave of 
relief sweeps over them. They pick up their occupations again. 
Anne flings open the door of Peter’s room, making a dramatic 
entrance. She is dressed in Peter’s clothes. Peter looks at her in 
fury. The others are amused.]
Anne. Good evening, everyone. Forgive me if I don’t stay. 
[She jumps up on a chair.] I have a friend waiting for me in 
there. My friend Tom. Tom Cat. Some people say that we look 
alike. But Tom has the most beautiful whiskers, and I have 
only a little fuzz. I am hoping . . . in time . . .
Peter. All right, Mrs. Quack Quack!
Anne. [Outraged—jumping down] Peter!
Peter. I heard about you . . . How you talked so much in 
class they called you Mrs. Quack Quack. How Mr. Smitter 
made you write a composition . . . “‘Quack, Quack,’ said 
Mrs. Quack Quack.”

read it out loud to the class and then read it to all his other 
classes!
Peter. Quack! Quack! Quack . . . Quack . . . Quack . . .
[Anne pulls off the coat and trousers.]
Anne. You are the most intolerable, insufferable boy I’ve 
ever met!
[She throws the clothes down the stairwell. Peter goes down . . . 
after them.]
Peter. Quack, quack, quack!
Mrs. Van Daan. [To Anne] That’s right, Anneke! Give it

locked up with one like you!

picks himself up, and goes on into his room.]
Mrs. Frank. [Quietly] Anne, dear . . . your hair. [She feels 
Anne’s forehead.] You’re warm. Are you feeling all right?
Anne. Please, Mother. [She goes over to the center table, slipping 
into her shoes.]
Mrs. Frank. [Following her] You haven’t a fever, have you?
Anne. [Pulling away] No. No.
Mrs. Frank. You know we can’t call a doctor here, ever. 
There’s only one thing to do . . . watch carefully. Prevent an 
illness before it comes. Let me see your tongue.
Anne. Mother, this is perfectly absurd.
Mrs. Frank. Anne, dear, don’t be such a baby. Let me see your 
tongue. [As Anne refuses, Mrs. Frank appeals to Mr. Frank] 
Otto . . . ?
Mr. Frank. You hear your mother, Anne.
[Anne flicks out her tongue for a second, then turns away.]
Mrs. Frank. Come on—open up! [As Anne opens her mouth 
very wide] You seem all right . . . but perhaps an aspirin . . .
Mrs. Van Daan. For heaven’s sake, don’t give that child any 
pills. I waited for fifteen minutes this morning for her to 
come out of the w.c.

Mr. Frank. I think there’s nothing the matter 
with our Anne that a ride on her bike, or a visit 
with her friend Jopie de Waal wouldn’t cure. 
Isn’t that so, Anne?
[Mr. Van Daan comes down into the room. From 
outside we hear faint sounds of bombers going over 
and a burst of ack-ack.18]
Mr. Van Daan. Miep not come yet?
Mrs. Van Daan. The workmen just left, a little 
while ago.
Mr. Van Daan. What’s for dinner tonight?
Mrs. Van Daan. Beans.
Mr. Van Daan. Not again!
Mrs. Van Daan. Poor Putti! I know. But what 
can we do? That’s all that Miep brought us.
[Mr. Van Daan starts to pace, his hands behind his 
back. Anne follows behind him, imitating him.]
Anne. We are now in what is known as the 
“bean cycle.” Beans boiled, beans en casserole, 
beans with strings, beans without strings . . .
[Peter has come out of his room. He slides into his 
place at the table, becoming immediately absorbed in 
his studies.]
Mr. Van Daan. [To Peter] I saw you . . . in there, playing with 
your cat.
Mrs. Van Daan. He just went in for a second, putting his coat 
away. He’s been out here all the time, doing his lessons.
Mr. Frank. [Looking up from the papers] Anne, you got an 
excellent in your history paper today . . . and very good in 
Latin.
Anne. [Sitting beside him] How about algebra?
Mr. Frank. I’ll have to make a confession. Up until now I’ve 
managed to stay ahead of you in algebra. Today you caught 
up with me. We’ll leave it to Margot to correct.
Anne. Isn’t algebra vile, Pim!
Mr. Frank. Vile!
Margot. [To Mr. Frank] How did I do?

with it. [Anne puts it on and struts with it.] My father gave me 
that the year before he died. He always bought the best that 
money could buy.
Anne. Mrs. Van Daan, did you have a lot of boy friends 
before you were married?
Mrs. Frank. Anne, that’s a personal question. It’s not 
courteous to ask personal questions.
Mrs. Van Daan. Oh I don’t mind. [To Anne] Our house was 
always swarming with boys. When I was a girl we had . . .
Mr. Van Daan. Oh, God. Not again!
Mrs. Van Daan. [Good-humored] Shut up! [Without a pause, to 
Anne, Mr. Van Daan mimics Mrs. Van Daan, speaking the first 
few words in unison with her.] One summer we had a big house 
in Hilversum. The boys came buzzing round like bees around 
a jam pot. And when I was sixteen! . . . We were wearing our 
skirts very short those days and I had good-looking legs. [She 
pulls up her skirt, going to Mr. Frank.] I still have ’em. I may 
not be as pretty as I used to be, but I still have my legs. How 
about it, Mr. Frank?
Mr. Van Daan. All right. All right. We see them.
Mrs. Van Daan. I’m not asking you. I’m asking Mr. Frank.
Peter. Mother, for heaven’s sake.
Mrs. Van Daan. Oh, I embarrass you, do I? Well, I just hope 
the girl you marry has as good. [Then to Anne] My father 
used to worry about me, with so many boys hanging round. 
He told me, if any of them gets fresh, you say to him . . . 
“Remember, Mr. So-and-So, remember I’m a lady.”
Anne. “Remember, Mr. So-and-So, remember I’m a lady.”
[She gives Mrs. Van Daan her coat.]
Mr. Van Daan. Look at you, talking that way in front of her! 
Don’t you know she puts it all down in that diary?
Mrs. Van Daan. So, if she does? I’m only telling the truth!
[Anne stretches out, putting her ear to the floor, listening to what 
is going on below. The sound of the bombers fades away.]

Mrs. Frank. [Setting the table] Would you mind, Peter, if I 
moved you over to the couch?
Anne. [Listening] Miep must have the radio on.
[Peter picks up his papers, going over to the couch beside 
Mrs. Van Daan.]
Mr. Van Daan. [Accusingly, to Peter] Haven’t you finished 
yet?
Peter. No.
Mr. Van Daan. You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
Peter. All right. All right. I’m a dunce. I’m a hopeless case. 
Why do I go on?
Mrs. Van Daan. You’re not hopeless. Don’t talk that way. It’s 
just that you haven’t anyone to help you, like the girls have. 
[To Mr. Frank] Maybe you could help him, Mr. Frank?
Mr. Frank. I’m sure that his father . . . ?
Mr. Van Daan. Not me. I can’t do anything with him. He 
won’t listen to me. You go ahead . . . if you want.
Mr. Frank. [Going to Peter] What about it, Peter? Shall we 
make our school coeducational?
Mrs. Van Daan. [Kissing Mr. Frank] You’re an angel, Mr. 
Frank. An angel. I don’t know why I didn’t meet you before I 
met that one there. Here, sit down, Mr. Frank . . . [She forces 
him down on the couch beside Peter.] Now, Peter, you listen to 
Mr. Frank.
Mr. Frank. It might be better for us to go into Peter’s room. 
[Peter jumps up eagerly, leading the way.]
Mrs. Van Daan. That’s right. You go in there, Peter. You listen 
to Mr. Frank. Mr. Frank is a highly educated man.
[As Mr. Frank is about to follow Peter into his room, Mrs. Frank 
stops him and wipes the lipstick from his lips. Then she closes the 
door after them.]
Anne. [On the floor, listening] Shh! I can hear a man’s voice 
talking.
Mr. Van Daan. [To Anne] Isn’t it bad enough here without 
your sprawling all over the place? 
[Anne sits up.]
Mrs. Van Daan. [To Mr. Van Daan] If you didn’t smoke so 
much, you wouldn’t be so bad-tempered.
Mr. Van Daan. Am I smoking? Do you see me smoking?

NOTES
Mrs. Van Daan. Don’t tell me you’ve used up all those 
cigarettes.
Mr. Van Daan. One package. Miep only brought me one 
package.
Mrs. Van Daan. It’s a filthy habit anyway. It’s a good time to 
break yourself.
Mr. Van Daan. Oh, stop it, please.
Mrs. Van Daan. You’re smoking up all our money. You know 
that, don’t you?
Mr. Van Daan. Will you shut up?
[During this, Mrs. Frank and Margot have studiously kept their 
eyes down. But Anne, seated on the floor, has been following the 
discussion interestedly. Mr. Van Daan turns to see her staring up 
at him.] And what are you staring at?
Anne. I never heard grownups quarrel before. I thought only 
children quarreled.
Mr. Van Daan. This isn’t a quarrel! It’s a discussion. And I 
never heard children so rude before.
Anne. [Rising, indignantly] I, rude!
Mr. Van Daan. Yes!
Mrs. Frank. [Quickly] Anne, will you get me my knitting? 
[Anne goes to get it.] I must remember, when Miep comes, to 
ask her to bring me some more wool.
Margot. [Going to her room] I need some hairpins and some 
soap. I made a list. [She goes into her bedroom to get the list.]
Mrs. Frank. [To Anne] Have you some library books for Miep 
when she comes?
Anne. It’s a wonder that Miep has a life of her own, the way 
we make her run errands for us. Please, Miep, get me some 
starch. Please take my hair out and have it cut. Tell me all the 
latest news, Miep. [She goes over, kneeling on the couch beside 
Mrs. Van Daan] Did you know she was engaged? His name is 
Dirk, and Miep’s afraid the Nazis will ship him off to 
Germany to work in one of their war plants. That’s what 
they’re doing with some of the young Dutchmen . . . they 
pick them up off the streets—
Mr. Van Daan. [Interrupting] Don’t you ever get tired of 
talking? Suppose you try keeping still for five minutes. Just 
five minutes.
[He starts to pace again. Again Anne follows him, mimicking him. 
Mrs. Frank jumps up and takes her by the arm up to the sink, and 
gives her a glass of milk.]

Mrs. Frank. Come here, Anne. It’s time for your glass of milk.
Mr. Van Daan. Talk, talk, talk. I never heard such a child. 
Where is my . . . ? Every evening it’s the same talk, talk, talk. 
[He looks around.] Where is my . . . ?
Mrs. Van Daan. What’re you looking for?
Mr. Van Daan. My pipe. Have you seen my pipe?
Mrs. Van Daan. What good’s a pipe? You haven’t got any 
tobacco.
Mr. Van Daan. At least I’ll have something to hold in my 
mouth! [Opening Margot’s bedroom door] Margot, have you 
seen my pipe?
Margot. It was on the table last night.
[Anne puts her glass of milk on the table and picks up his pipe, 
hiding it behind her back.]
Mr. Van Daan. I know. I know. Anne, did you see my 
pipe? . . . Anne!
Mrs. Frank. Anne, Mr. Van Daan is speaking to you.
Anne. Am I allowed to talk now?
Mr. Van Daan. You’re the most aggravating . . . The trouble 
with you is, you’ve been spoiled. What you need is a good 
old‑fashioned spanking.
Anne. [Mimicking Mrs. Van Daan] “Remember, Mr. 
So-and-So, remember I’m a lady.” [She thrusts the pipe into his 
mouth, then picks up her glass of milk.]
Mr. Van Daan. [Restraining himself with difficulty] Why aren’t 
you nice and quiet like your sister Margot? Why do you have 
to show off all the time? Let me give you a little advice, 
young lady. Men don’t like that kind of thing in a girl. You 
know that? A man likes a girl who’ll listen to him once in a 
while . . . a domestic girl, who’ll keep her house shining for 
her husband . . . who loves to cook and sew and . . .
Anne. I’d cut my throat first! I’d open my veins! I’m going to 
be remarkable! I’m going to Paris . . .
Mr. Van Daan. [Scoffingly] Paris!
Anne. . . . to study music and art.
Mr. Van Daan. Yeah! Yeah!
Anne. I’m going to be a famous dancer or singer . . . or 
something wonderful.
[She makes a wide gesture, spilling the glass of milk on the fur coat 
in Mrs. Van Daan’s lap. Margot rushes quickly over with a towel. 
Anne tries to brush the milk off with her skirt.]

Mrs. Van Daan. Now look what you’ve done . . . you clumsy 
little fool! My beautiful fur coat my father gave me . . .
Anne. I’m so sorry.
Mrs. Van Daan. What do you care? It isn’t yours . . . So go on, 
ruin it! Do you know what that coat cost? Do you? And now 
look at it! Look at it!
Anne. I’m very, very sorry.
Mrs. Van Daan. I could kill you for this. I could just kill you!
[Mrs. Van Daan goes up the stairs, clutching the coat. Mr. Van 
Daan starts after her.]
Mr. Van Daan. Petronella . . . Liefje! Liefje! . . . Come back . . . 
the supper . . . come back!
Mrs. Frank. Anne, you must not behave in that way.
Anne. It was an accident. Anyone can have an accident.
Mrs. Frank. I don’t mean that. I mean the answering back. 
You must not answer back. They are our guests. We must 
always show the greatest courtesy to them. We’re all living 
under terrible tension. [She stops as Margot indicates that 
Mr. Van Daan can hear. When he is gone, she continues.] That’s 
why we must control ourselves . . . You don’t hear Margot 
getting into arguments with them, do you? Watch Margot. 
She’s always courteous with them. Never familiar. She keeps 
her distance. And they respect her for it. Try to be like 
Margot.
Anne. And have them walk all over me, the way they do her? 
No, thanks!
Mrs. Frank. I’m not afraid that anyone is going to walk all 
over you, Anne. I’m afraid for other people, that you’ll walk 
on them. I don’t know what happens to you, Anne. You are 
wild, self‑willed. If I had ever talked to my mother as you 
talk to me . . .
Anne. Things have changed. People aren’t like that any more. 
“Yes, Mother.” “No, Mother.” “Anything you say, Mother.” 
I’ve got to fight things out for myself! Make something of 
myself!
Mrs. Frank. It isn’t necessary to fight to do it. Margot doesn’t 
fight, and isn’t she . . . ?
Anne. [Violently rebellious] Margot! Margot! Margot! That’s all 
I hear from everyone . . . how wonderful Margot is . . . “Why 
aren’t you like Margot?” 
Margot. [Protesting] Oh, come on, Anne, don’t be so . . .

Anne. [Paying no attention] Everything she does is right, and 
everything I do is wrong! I’m the goat around here! . . . You’re 
all against me! . . . And you worst of all!
[She rushes off into her room and throws herself down on the settee, 
stifling her sobs. Mrs. Frank sighs and starts toward the stove.]
Mrs. Frank. [To Margot] Let’s put the soup on the stove . . . if 
there’s anyone who cares to eat. Margot, will you take the 
bread out? [Margot gets the bread from the cupboard.] I don’t 
know how we can go on living this way . . . I can’t say a word

Margot. You know Anne. In half an hour she’ll be out here,

Mrs. Frank. Every time I hear that sound, my heart stops!

door.] Father?

Margot. I’ll get my books. [Giving her mother a list] Here’s 
your list. [Margot goes into her and Anne’s bedroom on the right. 
Anne sits up, hiding her tears, as Margot comes in.] Miep’s here.

the mirror, smoothing her hair.]
Mr. Van Daan. [Coming down the stairs] Is it Miep?
Margot. Yes. Father’s gone down to let her in. 
Mr. Van Daan. At last I’ll have some cigarettes!
Mrs. Frank. [To Mr. Van Daan] I can’t tell you how unhappy 
I am about Mrs. Van Daan’s coat. Anne should never have

[He turns to meet Miep. But it is not Miep who comes up the 
steps. It is Mr. Kraler, followed by Mr. Frank. Their faces are 
grave. Anne comes from the bedroom. Peter comes from his room.]
Mrs. Frank. Mr. Kraler!
Mr. Van Daan. How are you, Mr. Kraler?
Margot. This is a surprise.
Mrs. Frank. When Mr. Kraler comes, the sun begins to shine.
Mr. Van Daan. Miep is coming?
Mr. Kraler. Not tonight.
[Mr. Kraler goes to Margot and Mrs. Frank and Anne, shaking 
hands with them.]
Mrs. Frank. Wouldn’t you like a cup of coffee? . . . Or, better 
still, will you have supper with us?
Mr. Frank. Mr. Kraler has something to talk over with us. 
Something has happened, he says, which demands an 
immediate decision.
Mrs. Frank. [Fearful] What is it?
[Mr. Kraler sits down on the couch. As he talks he takes bread, 
cabbages, milk, etc., from his briefcase, giving them to Margot and 
Anne to put away.]
Mr. Kraler. Usually, when I come up here, I try to bring you 
some bit of good news. What’s the use of telling you the bad 
news when there’s nothing that you can do about it? But 
today something has happened . . . Dirk . . . Miep’s Dirk, you 
know, came to me just now. He tells me that he has a Jewish 
friend living near him. A dentist. He says he’s in trouble. He 
begged me, could I do anything for this man? Could I find 
him a hiding place? . . . So I’ve come to you . . . I know it’s a 
terrible thing to ask of you, living as you are, but would you 
take him in with you?
Mr. Frank. Of course we will.
Mr. Kraler. [Rising] It’ll be just for a night or two . . . until I 
find some other place. This happened so suddenly that I 
didn’t know where to turn.
Mr. Frank. Where is he?
Mr. Kraler. Downstairs in the office.
Mr. Frank. Good. Bring him up.
Mr. Kraler. His name is Dussel . . . Jan Dussel.

Mr. Van Daan. There’s no reason for you to 
consult anyone. This is your place. You have 
a right to do exactly as you please. The only

Dussel.

Mr. Frank. [To Anne] You don’t mind sharing your room with 
Mr. Dussel, do you, Anne?
Anne. No. No, of course not.
Mr. Frank. Good. [Anne goes off into her bedroom, helping 
Margot. Mr. Frank starts to search in the cupboards.] Where’s 
the cognac?
Mrs. Frank. It’s there. But, Otto, I was saving it in case of 
illness.
Mr. Frank. I think we couldn’t find a better time to use it. 
Peter, will you get five glasses for me?
[Peter goes for the glasses. Margot comes out of her bedroom, 
carrying her possessions, which she hangs behind a curtain in the 
main room. Mr. Frank finds the cognac and pours it into the five 
glasses that Peter brings him. Mr. Van Daan stands looking on 
sourly. Mrs. Van Daan comes downstairs and looks around at all 
the bustle.]
Mrs. Van Daan. What’s happening? What’s going on?
Mr. Van Daan. Someone’s moving in with us.

him another place.

[Mr. Frank hurries over as Mr. Kraler and Dussel come up. 
Dussel is a man in his late fifties, meticulous, finicky . . . 
bewildered now. He wears a raincoat. He carries a briefcase, stuffed 
full, and a small medicine case.]
Mr. Frank. Come in, Mr. Dussel.
Mr. Kraler. This is Mr. Frank.
Dussel. Mr. Otto Frank?
Mr. Frank. Yes. Let me take your things. [He takes the hat and 
briefcase, but Dussel clings to his medicine case.] This is my wife, 
Edith . . . Mr. and Mrs. Van Daan . . . their son, Peter . . . and 
my daughters, Margot and Anne.
[Dussel shakes hands with everyone.]
Mr. Kraler. Thank you, Mr. Frank. Thank you all. Mr. Dussel, 
I leave you in good hands. Oh . . . Dirk’s coat.

life line. Without them we couldn’t live.
Mr. Kraler. Please. Please. You make us seem very heroic. It 
isn’t that at all. We simply don’t like the Nazis. [To Mr. Frank, 
who offers him a drink] No, thanks. [Then going on] We don’t 
like their methods. We don’t like . . .

us Dutchmen what to do with our damn Jews!”
Mr. Kraler. [To Dussel] Pay no attention to Mr. Frank. I’ll be 
up tomorrow to see that they’re treating you right. [To Mr. 
Frank] Don’t trouble to come down again. Peter will bolt the

cognac.]
Dussel. I’m dreaming. I know it. I can’t believe my eyes.

disorder, dishes in the sink. She said she found a piece of 
paper in the wastebasket with an address scribbled on it . . . 
an address in Zurich. She said you must have escaped to 
Zurich.
Anne. Father put that there purposely . . . just so people 
would think that very thing!
Dussel. And you’ve been here all the time?
Mrs. Frank. All the time . . . ever since July.

Anne. It worked, Pim . . . the address you left! Mr. Dussel 
says that people believe we escaped to Switzerland.

NOTES
To Mr. Dussel. Welcome. We’re very honored to have you 
with us.
Mrs. Frank. To Mr. Dussel, welcome.
[The Van Daans murmur a welcome. The “grownups” drink.]
Mrs. Van Daan. Um. That was good.
Mr. Van Daan. Did Mr. Kraler warn you that you won’t get 
much to eat here? You can imagine . . . three ration books 
among the seven of us . . . and now you make eight. 
[Peter walks away, humiliated. Outside a street organ is heard dimly.]
Dussel. [Rising] Mr. Van Daan, you don’t realize what is 
happening outside that you should warn me of a thing like 
that. You don’t realize what’s going on . . . [As Mr. Van Daan 
starts his characteristic pacing, Dussel turns to speak to the 
others.] Right here in Amsterdam every day hundreds of Jews 
disappear . . . They surround a block and search house by 
house. Children come home from school to find their parents 
gone. Hundreds are being deported . . . people that you and 
I know . . . the Hallensteins . . . the Wessels . . .
Mrs. Frank. [In tears] Oh, no. No!
Dussel. They get their call-up notice . . . come to the Jewish 
theater on such and such a day and hour . . . bring only what 
you can carry in a rucksack. And if you refuse the call-up 
notice, then they come and drag you from your home and 
ship you off to Mauthausen.20 The death camp!
Mrs. Frank. We didn’t know that things had got so much 
worse.
Dussel. Forgive me for speaking so.
Anne. [Coming to Dussel] Do you know the de Waals? . . . 
What’s become of them? Their daughter Jopie and I are in the 
same class. Jopie’s my best friend.
Dussel. They are gone.
Anne. Gone?
Dussel. With all the others.
Anne. Oh, no. Not Jopie!
[She turns away, in tears. Mrs. Frank motions to Margot to 
comfort her. Margot goes to Anne, putting her arms comfortingly 
around her.]
Mrs. Van Daan. There were some people called Wagner. They 
lived near us . . . ?

Mr. Frank. [Interrupting, with a glance at Anne] I think we 
should put this off until later. We all have many questions we 
want to ask . . . But I’m sure that Mr. Dussel would like to get 
settled before supper.
Dussel. Thank you. I would. I brought very little with me.
Mr. Frank. [Giving him his hat and briefcase] I’m sorry we can’t 
give you a room alone. But I hope you won’t be too 
uncomfortable. We’ve had to make strict rules here . . . a 
schedule of hours . . . We’ll tell you after supper. Anne, would 
you like to take Mr. Dussel to his room?
Anne. [Controlling her tears] If you’ll come with me, 
Mr. Dussel? [She starts for her room.]
Dussel. [Shaking hands with each in turn] Forgive me if I 
haven’t really expressed my gratitude to all of you. This has 
been such a shock to me. I’d always thought of myself as 
Dutch. I was born in Holland. My father was born in 
Holland, and my grandfather. And now . . . after all these 
years . . . [He breaks off.] If you’ll excuse me.
[Dussel gives a little bow and hurries off after Anne. Mr. Frank 
and the others are subdued.]
Anne. [Turning on the light] Well, here we are.
[Dussel looks around the room. In the main room Margot speaks to 
her mother.]
Margot. The news sounds pretty bad, doesn’t it? It’s so 
different from what Mr. Kraler tells us. Mr. Kraler says things 
are improving.
Mr. Van Daan. I like it better the way Kraler tells it.
[They resume their occupations, quietly. Peter goes off into his 
room. In Anne’s room, Anne turns to Dussel.]
Anne. You’re going to share the room with me.
Dussel. I’m a man who’s always lived alone. I haven’t had to 
adjust myself to others. I hope you’ll bear with me until I 
learn.
Anne. Let me help you. [She takes his briefcase.] Do you always 
live all alone? Have you no family at all?
Dussel. No one. [He opens his medicine case and spreads his 
bottles on the dressing table.]
Anne. How dreadful. You must be terribly lonely.
Dussel. I’m used to it.
Anne. I don’t think I could ever get used to it. Didn’t you 
even have a pet? A cat, or a dog?

Dussel. I have an allergy for fur-bearing animals. They give 
me asthma.
Anne. Oh, dear. Peter has a cat.
Dussel. Here? He has it here?
Anne. Yes. But we hardly ever see it. He keeps it in his room 
all the time. I’m sure it will be all right.
Dussel. Let us hope so. [He takes some pills to fortify himself.]
Anne. That’s Margot’s bed, where you’re going to sleep. I 
sleep on the sofa there. [Indicating the clothes hooks on the wall] 
We cleared these off for your things. [She goes over to the 
window.] The best part about this room . . . you can look down 
and see a bit of the street and the canal. There’s a 
houseboat . . . you can see the end of it . . . a bargeman lives 
there with his family . . . They have a baby and he’s just 
beginning to walk and I’m so afraid he’s going to fall into the 
canal some day. I watch him . . .
Dussel. [Interrupting] Your father spoke of a schedule.
Anne. [Coming away from the window] Oh, yes. It’s mostly 
about the times we have to be quiet. And times for the w.c. 
You can use it now if you like.
Dussel. [Stiffly] No, thank you.
Anne. I suppose you think it’s awful, my talking about a 
thing like that. But you don’t know how important it can get 
to be, especially when you’re frightened . . . About this room, 
the way Margot and I did . . . she had it to herself in the 
afternoons for studying, reading . . . lessons, you know . . . 
and I took the mornings. Would that be all right with you?
Dussel. I’m not at my best in the morning.
Anne. You stay here in the mornings then. I’ll take the room 
in the afternoons.
Dussel. Tell me, when you’re in here, what happens to me? 
Where am I spending my time? In there, with all the people?
Anne. Yes.
Dussel. I see. I see.
Anne. We have supper at half past six.
Dussel. [Going over to the sofa] Then, if you don’t mind . . . I 
like to lie down quietly for ten minutes before eating. I find it 
helps the digestion.
Anne. Of course. I hope I’m not going to be too much of a 
bother to you. I seem to be able to get everyone’s back up.

Dussel. I always get along very well with children. My 
patients all bring their children to me, because they know I 
get on well with them. So don’t you worry about that.
[Anne leans over him, taking his hand and shaking it gratefully.]
Anne. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Dussel.
[The lights dim to darkness. The curtain falls on the scene. Anne’s 
Voice comes to us faintly at first, and then with increasing power.]
Anne’s Voice. . . . And yesterday I finished Cissy Van 
Marxvelt’s latest book. I think she is a first-class writer. I shall 
definitely let my children read her. Monday the twenty-first 
of September, nineteen forty-two. Mr. Dussel and I had 
another battle yesterday. Yes, Mr. Dussel! According to him, 
nothing, I repeat . . . nothing, is right about me . . . my 
appearance, my character, my manners. While he was going 
on at me I thought . . . sometime I’ll give you such a smack 
that you’ll fly right up to the ceiling! Why is it that every 
grownup thinks he knows the way to bring up children? 
Particularly the grownups that never had any. I keep wishing 
that Peter was a girl instead of a boy. Then I would have 
someone to talk to. Margot’s a darling, but she takes 
everything too seriously. To pause for a moment on the 
subject of Mrs. Van Daan. I must tell you that her attempts to 
flirt with Father are getting her nowhere. Pim, thank 
goodness, won’t play.
[As she is saying the last lines, the curtain rises on the darkened 
scene. Anne’s Voice fades out.]

Scene 4
[It is the middle of the night, several months later. The stage is dark 
except for a little light which comes through the skylight in Peter’s 
room.
Everyone is in bed. Mr. and Mrs. Frank lie on the couch in the 
main room, which has been pulled out to serve as a makeshift 
double bed.
Margot is sleeping on a mattress on the floor in the main room, 
behind a curtain stretched across for privacy. The others are all in 
their accustomed rooms.
From outside we hear two drunken soldiers singing “Lili Marlene.” 
A girl’s high giggle is heard. The sound of running feet is heard

coming closer and then fading in the distance. Throughout the 
scene there is the distant sound of airplanes passing overhead.
A match suddenly flares up in the attic. We dimly see Mr. Van 
Daan. He is getting his bearings. He comes quickly down the 
stairs, and goes to the cupboard where the food is stored. Again the 
match flares up, and is as quickly blown out.
The dim figure is seen to steal back up the stairs. 
There is quiet for a second or two, broken only by the sound of 
airplanes, and running feet on the street below.
Suddenly, out of the silence and the dark, we hear Anne scream.]
Anne. [Screaming] No! No! Don’t . . . don’t take me!
[She moans, tossing and crying in her sleep. The other people wake, 
terrified. Dussel sits up in bed, furious.]
Dussel. Shush! Anne! Anne, for God’s sake, shush!
Anne. [Still in her nightmare] Save me! Save me!
[She screams and screams. Dussel gets out of bed, going over to 
her, trying to wake her.]
Dussel. For God’s sake! Quiet! Quiet! You want someone to 
hear?
[In the main room Mrs. Frank grabs a shawl and pulls it around 
her. She rushes in to Anne, taking her in her arms. Mr. Frank 
hurriedly gets up, putting on his overcoat. Margot sits up, 
terrified. Peter’s light goes on in his room.]
Mrs. Frank. [To Anne, in her room] Hush, darling, hush. It’s 
all right. It’s all right. [Over her shoulder to Dussel] Will you be 
kind enough to turn on the light, Mr. Dussel? [Back to Anne] 
It’s nothing, my darling. It was just a dream.

[Dussel turns on the light in the bedroom. Mrs. Frank holds Anne 
in her arms. Gradually Anne comes out of her nightmare still 
trembling with horror. Mr. Frank comes into the room, and goes 
quickly to the window, looking out to be sure that no one outside 
has heard Anne’s screams. Mrs. Frank holds Anne, talking softly 
to her. In the main room Margot stands on a chair, turning on the 
center hanging lamp. A light goes on in the Van Daans’ room 
overhead. Peter puts his robe on, coming out of his room.]
Dussel. [To Mrs. Frank, blowing his nose] Something must be 
done about that child, Mrs. Frank. Yelling like that! Who 
knows but there’s somebody on the streets? She’s 
endangering all our lives.
Mrs. Frank. Anne, darling.
Dussel. Every night she twists and turns. I don’t sleep. I 
spend half my night shushing her. And now it’s nightmares!
[Margot comes to the door of Anne’s room, followed by Peter. 
Mr. Frank goes to them, indicating that everything is all right. 
Peter takes Margot back.]
Mrs. Frank. [To Anne] You’re here, safe, you see? Nothing has 
happened. [To Dussel] Please, Mr. Dussel, go back to bed. 
She’ll be herself in a minute or two. Won’t you, Anne?
Dussel. [Picking up a book and a pillow] Thank you, but I’m 
going to the w.c. The one place where there’s peace!
[He stalks out. Mr. Van Daan, in underwear and trousers, comes 
down the stairs.]
Mr. Van Daan. [To Dussel] What is it? What happened?
Dussel. A nightmare. She was having a nightmare!
Mr. Van Daan. I thought someone was murdering her. 
Dussel. Unfortunately, no.
[He goes into the bathroom. Mr. Van Daan goes back up the stairs. 
Mr. Frank, in the main room, sends Peter back to his own 
bedroom.]
Mr. Frank. Thank you, Peter. Go back to bed.
[Peter goes back to his room. Mr. Frank follows him, turning out 
the light and looking out the window. Then he goes back to the main 
room, and gets up on a chair, turning out the center hanging lamp.]
Mrs. Frank. [To Anne] Would you like some water? [Anne 
shakes her head.] Was it a very bad dream? Perhaps if you told 
me . . . ?
Anne. I’d rather not talk about it.

Mrs. Frank. Poor darling. Try to sleep then. I’ll sit right here 
beside you until you fall asleep. [She brings a stool over, 
sitting there.]
Anne. You don’t have to.
Mrs. Frank. But I’d like to stay with you . . . very much. 
Really.
Anne. I’d rather you didn’t.
Mrs. Frank. Good night, then. [She leans down to kiss Anne. 
Anne throws her arm up over her face, turning away. Mrs. Frank, 
hiding her hurt, kisses Anne’s arm.] You’ll be all right? There’s 
nothing that you want?
Anne. Will you please ask Father to come.
Mrs. Frank. [After a second] Of course, Anne dear. [She hurries 
out into the other room. Mr. Frank comes to her as she comes in.] 
Sie verlangt nach Dir!21
Mr. Frank. [Sensing her hurt] Edith, Liebe, schau22 . . .
Mrs. Frank. Es macht nichts! Ich danke dem lieben Herrgott, dass 
sie sich wenigstens an Dich wendet, wenn sie Trost braucht! Geh 
hinein, Otto, sie ist ganz hysterisch vor Angst.23 [As Mr. Frank 
hesitates] Geh zu ihr.24 [He looks at her for a second and then goes 
to get a cup of water for Anne. Mrs. Frank sinks down on the bed, 
her face in her hands, trying to keep from sobbing aloud. Margot 
comes over to her, putting her arms around her.] She wants 
nothing of me. She pulled away when I leaned down to 
kiss her.
Margot. It’s a phase . . . You heard Father . . . Most girls go 
through it . . . they turn to their fathers at this age . . . they 
give all their love to their fathers.
Mrs. Frank. You weren’t like this. You didn’t shut me out.
Margot. She’ll get over it . . .
[She smooths the bed for Mrs. Frank and sits beside her a moment 
as Mrs. Frank lies down. In Anne’s room Mr. Frank comes in, 
sitting down by Anne. Anne flings her arms around him, clinging 
to him. In the distance we hear the sound of ack-ack.]
Anne. Oh, Pim. I dreamed that they came to get us! The 
Green Police! They broke down the door and grabbed me 
and started to drag me out the way they did Jopie.
Mr. Frank. I want you to take this pill.

out the light and goes back to her bed.]
Mr. Frank. [To Anne] Do you want me to read to you for a 
while?
Anne. No. Just sit with me for a minute. Was I awful? Did I 
yell terribly loud? Do you think anyone outside could have 
heard?
Mr. Frank. No. No. Lie quietly now. Try to sleep.
Anne. I’m a terrible coward. I’m so disappointed in myself. 
I think I’ve conquered my fear . . . I think I’m really 
grownup . . . and then something happens . . . and I run to 
you like a baby . . . I love you, Father. I don’t love anyone 
but you.
Mr. Frank. [Reproachfully] Annele!
Anne. It’s true. I’ve been thinking about it for a long time. 
You’re the only one I love.
Mr. Frank. It’s fine to hear you tell me that you love me. But 
I’d be happier if you said you loved your mother as well . . . 
She needs your help so much . . . your love . . .
Anne. We have nothing in common. She doesn’t understand 
me. Whenever I try to explain my views on life to her she 
asks me if I’m constipated.
Mr. Frank. You hurt her very much just now. She’s crying. 
She’s in there crying.
Anne. I can’t help it. I only told the truth. I didn’t want her 
here . . . [Then, with sudden change] Oh, Pim, I was horrible, 
wasn’t I? And the worst of it is, I can stand off and look at 
myself doing it and know it’s cruel and yet I can’t stop doing 
it. What’s the matter with me? Tell me. Don’t say it’s just a 
phase! Help me.
Mr. Frank. There is so little that we parents can do to help 
our children. We can only try to set a good example . . . point 
the way. The rest you must do yourself. You must build your 
own character.
Anne. I’m trying. Really I am. Every night I think back over 
all of the things I did that day that were wrong . . . like 
putting the wet mop in Mr. Dussel’s bed . . . and this thing 
now with Mother. I say to myself, that was wrong. I make up 
my mind, I’m never going to do that again. Never! Of course 
I may do something worse . . . but at least I’ll never do that 
again! . . . I have a nicer side, Father . . . a sweeter, nicer side.

off the light, and starts out. The lights dim out. The curtain falls on 
the scene. Anne’s Voice is heard dimly at first, and then with 
growing strength.]
Anne’s Voice . . . The air raids are getting worse. They come 
over day and night. The noise is terrifying. Pim says it should 
be music to our ears. The more planes, the sooner will come 
the end of the war. Mrs. Van Daan pretends to be a fatalist. 
What will be, will be. But when the planes come over, who is 
the most frightened? No one else but Petronella! . . . Monday, 
the ninth of November, nineteen forty-two. Wonderful news! 
The Allies have landed in Africa. Pim says that we can look 
for an early finish to the war. Just for fun he asked each of us 
what was the first thing we wanted to do when we got out of 
here. Mrs. Van Daan longs to be home with her own things, 
her needlepoint chairs, the Beckstein piano her father gave 
her . . . the best that money could buy. Peter would like to go 
to a movie. Mr. Dussel wants to get back to his dentist’s drill. 
He’s afraid he is losing his touch. For myself, there are so 
many things . . . to ride a bike again . . . to laugh till my belly 
aches . . . to have new clothes from the skin out . . . to have a 
hot tub filled to overflowing and wallow in it for hours . . . to 
be back in school with my friends . . .

this Hanukkah light to celebrate the great and wonderful 
deeds wrought through the zeal with which God filled the 
hearts of the heroic Maccabees, two thousand years ago. They

night you light two candles, the next night three . . . and so on 
until you have eight candles burning. When there are eight 
candles it is truly beautiful.
Mrs. Van Daan. And the potato pancakes.
Mr. Van Daan. Don’t talk about them!
Mrs. Van Daan. I make the best latkes you ever tasted!
Mrs. Frank. Invite us all next year . . . in your own home.
Mr. Frank. God willing!
Mrs. Van Daan. God willing.
Margot. What I remember best is the presents we used to get 
when we were little . . . eight days of presents . . . and each 
day they got better and better.
Mrs. Frank. [Sitting down] We are all here, alive. That is 
present enough.
Anne. No, it isn’t. I’ve got something . . . [She rushes into her 
room, hurriedly puts on a little hat improvised from the lamp shade, 
grabs a satchel bulging with parcels and comes running back.]
Mrs. Frank. What is it?
Anne. Presents!
Mrs. Van Daan. Presents!
Dussel. Look!

NOTES
Mr. Van Daan. What’s she got on her head?
Peter. A lamp shade!
Anne. [She picks out one at random.] This is for Margot. [She 
hands it to Margot, pulling her to her feet.] Read it out loud.
Margot. [Reading]
“You have never lost your temper.
You never will, I fear,
You are so good.
But if you should,
Put all your cross words here.”
[She tears open the package.] A new crossword puzzle book! 
Where did you get it?
Anne. It isn’t new. It’s one that you’ve done. But I rubbed it 
all out, and if you wait a little and forget, you can do it all 
over again.
Margot. [Sitting] It’s wonderful, Anne. Thank you. You’d 
never know it wasn’t new.
[From outside we hear the sound of a streetcar passing.]
Anne. [With another gift] Mrs. Van Daan.
Mrs. Van Daan. [Taking it] This is awful . . . I haven’t 
anything for anyone . . . I never thought . . .
Mr. Frank. This is all Anne’s idea.
Mrs. Van Daan. [Holding up a bottle] What is it?
Anne. It’s hair shampoo. I took all the odds and ends of soap 
and mixed them with the last of my toilet water.
Mrs. Van Daan. Oh, Anneke!
Anne. I wanted to write a poem for all of them, but I didn’t 
have time. [Offering a large box to Mr. Van Daan] Yours, Mr. 
Van Daan, is really something . . . something you want more 
than anything. [As she waits for him to open it] Look! 
Cigarettes!
Mr. Van Daan. Cigarettes!
Anne. Two of them! Pim found some old pipe tobacco in the 
pocket lining of his coat . . . and we made them . . . or rather. 
Pim did.
Mrs. Van Daan. Let me see . . . Well, look at that! Light it, 
Putti! Light it.
[Mr. Van Daan hesitates.]
Anne. It’s tobacco, really it is! There’s a little fluff in it, but 
not much.

[Everyone watches intently as Mr. Van Daan cautiously lights it. 
The cigarette flares up. Everyone laughs.]
Peter. It works!
Mrs. Van Daan. Look at him.
Mr. Van Daan. [Spluttering] Thank you, Anne. Thank you.
[Anne rushes back to her satchel for another present.]
Anne. [Handing her mother a piece of paper] For Mother, 
Hanukkah greeting.
[She pulls her mother to her feet.]
Mrs. Frank. [She reads] “Here’s an I.O.U. that I promise to 
pay. Ten hours of doing whatever you say. Signed, Anne 
Frank.” [Mrs. Frank, touched, takes Anne in her arms, holding 
her close.]
Dussel. [To Anne] Ten hours of doing what you’re told? 
Anything you’re told?
Anne. That’s right.
Dussel. You wouldn’t want to sell that, Mrs. Frank?
Mrs. Frank. Never! This is the most precious gift I’ve ever 
had!
[She sits, showing her present to the others. Anne hurries back to 
the satchel and pulls out a scarf, the scarf that Mr. Frank found in 
the first scene.]
Anne. [Offering it to her father] For Pim.
Mr. Frank. Anneke . . . I wasn’t supposed to have a present!
[He takes it, unfolding it and showing it to the others.]
Anne. It’s a muffler . . . to put round your neck . . . like an 
ascot, you know. I made it myself out of odds and ends . . . I 
knitted it in the dark each night, after I’d gone to bed. I’m 
afraid it looks better in the dark!
Mr. Frank. [Putting it on] It’s fine. It fits me perfectly. Thank 
you, Annele.
[Anne hands Peter a ball of paper with a string attached to it.]
Anne. That’s for Mouschi.
Peter. [Rising to bow] On behalf of Mouschi, I thank you. 
Anne. [Hesitant, handing him a gift] And . . . this is yours . . . 
from Mrs. Quack Quack. [As he holds it gingerly in his hands] 
Well . . . open it . . . Aren’t you going to open it?

Peter. I’m scared to. I know something’s going to jump out 
and hit me.
Anne. No. It’s nothing like that, really.
Mrs. Van Daan. [As he is opening it] What is it, Peter? Go on. 
Show it.
Anne. [Excitedly] It’s a safety razor!
Dussel. A what?
Anne. A razor!
Mrs. Van Daan. [Looking at it] You didn’t make that out of 
odds and ends.
Anne. [To Peter] Miep got it for me. It’s not new. It’s 
secondhand. But you really do need a razor now.
Dussel. For what?
Anne. Look on his upper lip . . . you can see the beginning of 
a mustache.
Dussel. He wants to get rid of that? Put a little milk on it and 
let the cat lick it off.
Peter. [Starting for his room] Think you’re funny, don’t you. 
Dussel. Look! He can’t wait! He’s going in to try it!
Peter. I’m going to give Mouschi his present!
[He goes into his room, slamming the door behind him.]
Mr. Van Daan. [Disgustedly] Mouschi, Mouschi, Mouschi.
[In the distance we hear a dog persistently barking. Anne brings a 
gift to Dussel.]
Anne. And last but never least, my roommate, Mr. Dussel.
Dussel. For me? You have something for me? 
[He opens the small box she gives him.]
Anne. I made them myself. 
Dussel. [Puzzled] Capsules! Two capsules! 
Anne. They’re ear-plugs!
Dussel. Ear-plugs?
Anne. To put in your ears so you won’t hear me when I 
thrash around at night. I saw them advertised in a magazine. 
They’re not real ones . . . I made them out of cotton and

Dussel. Huh?
Anne. Are you ready?
Dussel. Good God! They’ve gone inside! I can’t get them out!

Mr. Van Daan. A real Hanukkah!
	
Mrs. Van Daan. Wasn’t it cute of her?
	
Mrs. Frank. I don’t know when she did it.
	
Margot. I love my present.
Anne. [Sitting at the table] And now let’s have the song, 
Father . . . please . . . [To Dussel] Have you heard the 
Hanukkah song, Mr. Dussel? The song is the whole thing! 
[She sings.] “Oh, Hanukkah! Oh, Hanukkah! The sweet 
celebration . . .”
Mr. Frank. [Quieting her] I’m afraid, Anne, we shouldn’t sing 
that song tonight. [To Dussel] It’s a song of jubilation, of 
rejoicing. One is apt to become too enthusiastic.
Anne. Oh, please, please. Let’s sing the song. I promise not to 
shout!
Mr. Frank. Very well. But quietly now . . . I’ll keep an eye on 
you and when . . .
[As Anne starts to sing, she is interrupted by Dussel, who is 
snorting and wheezing.]
Dussel. [Pointing to Peter] You . . . You! [Peter is coming from 
his bedroom, ostentatiously holding a bulge in his coat as if he were 
holding his cat, and dangling Anne’s present before it.] How 
many times . . . I told you . . . Out! Out!
Mr. Van Daan. [Going to Peter] What’s the matter with you? 
Haven’t you any sense? Get that cat out of here.

Mr. Van Daan. You heard me. Get it out of here!
Peter. I have no cat. [Delighted with his joke, he opens his coat 
and pulls out a bath towel. The group at the table laugh, enjoying 
the joke.]
Dussel. [Still wheezing] It doesn’t need to be the cat, his 
clothes are enough . . . when he comes out of that room . . .
Mr. Van Daan. Don’t worry. You won’t be bothered any 
more. We’re getting rid of it.
Dussel. At last you listen to me. [He goes off into his bedroom.]
Mr. Van Daan. [Calling after him] I’m not doing it for you. 
That’s all in your mind . . . all of it! [He starts back to his place at 
the table.] I’m doing it because I’m sick of seeing that cat eat 
all our food.
Peter. That’s not true! I only give him bones . . . scraps . . .
Mr. Van Daan. Don’t tell me! He gets fatter every day! Damn 
cat looks better than any of us. Out he goes tonight!
Peter. No! No!
Anne. Mr. Van Daan, you can’t do that! That’s Peter’s cat.

Mr. Van Daan. Go! Go!
Mrs. Van Daan. You’re not going and the cat’s not going! 
Now please . . . this is Hanukkah . . . Hanukkah . . . this is the 
time to celebrate . . . What’s the matter with all of you? Come 
on, Anne. Let’s have the song.
Anne. [Singing]
“Oh, Hanukkah! Oh, Hanukkah! The sweet celebration.”
Mr. Frank. [Rising] I think we should first blow out the 
candle . . . then we’ll have something for tomorrow night.
Margot. But, Father, you’re supposed to let it burn itself out.
Mr. Frank. I’m sure that God understands shortages. [Before 
blowing it out] “Praised be Thou, oh Lord our God, who hast 
sustained us and permitted us to celebrate this joyous 
festival.”
[He is about to blow out the candle when suddenly there is a crash 
of something falling below. They all freeze in horror, motionless. For 
a few seconds there is complete silence. Mr. Frank slips off his 
shoes. The others noiselessly follow his example. Mr. Frank turns 
out a light near him. He motions to Peter to turn off the center 
lamp. Peter tries to reach it, realizes he cannot and gets up on a 
chair. Just as he is touching the lamp he loses his balance. The chair 
goes out from under him. He falls. The iron lamp shade crashes to 
the floor. There is a sound of feet below, running down the stairs.]
Mr. Van Daan. [Under his breath] God Almighty! [The only 
light left comes from the Hanukkah candle. Dussel comes from his 
room. Mr. Frank creeps over to the stairwell and stands listening. 
The dog is heard barking excitedly.] Do you hear anything?
Mr. Frank. [In a whisper] No. I think they’ve gone. 
Mrs. Van Daan. It’s the Green Police. They’ve found us.
Mr. Frank. If they had, they wouldn’t have left. They’d be up 
here by now.
Mrs. Van Daan. I know it’s the Green Police. They’ve gone to 
get help. That’s all. They’ll be back!
Mr. Van Daan. Or it may have been the Gestapo,29 looking for 
papers . . .
Mr. Frank. [Interrupting] Or a thief, looking for money.
Mrs. Van Daan. We’ve got to do something . . . Quick! Quick! 
Before they come back.

[Mr. Frank holds up his hand for them to be quiet. He is listening 
intently. There is complete silence as they all strain to hear any 
sound from below. Suddenly Anne begins to sway. With a low cry 
she falls to the floor in a faint. Mrs. Frank goes to her quickly, 
sitting beside her on the floor and taking her in her arms.]
Mrs. Frank. Get some water, please! Get some water!
[Margot starts for the sink.]
Mr. Van Daan. [Grabbing Margot] No! No! No one’s going to 
run water!
Mr. Frank. If they’ve found us, they’ve found us. Get the 
water. [Margot starts again for the sink. Mr. Frank, getting a 
flashlight] I’m going down. 
[Margot rushes to him, clinging to him. Anne struggles to 
consciousness.]
Margot. No, Father, no! There may be someone there, 
waiting . . . It may be a trap!
Mr. Frank. This is Saturday. There is no way for us to know 
what has happened until Miep or Mr. Kraler comes on 
Monday morning. We cannot live with this uncertainty.
Margot. Don’t go, Father!
Mrs. Frank. Hush, darling, hush. [Mr. Frank slips quietly out, 
down the steps and out through the door below.] Margot! Stay 
close to me. [Margot goes to her mother.]
Mr. Van Daan. Shush! Shush!
[Mrs. Frank whispers to Margot to get the water. Margot goes 
for it.]
Mrs. Van Daan. Putti, where’s our money? Get our money. I 
hear you can buy the Green Police off, so much a head. Go 
upstairs quick! Get the money!
Mr. Van Daan. Keep still!
Mrs. Van Daan. [Kneeling before him, pleading] Do you want to 
be dragged off to a concentration camp? Are you going to 
stand there and wait for them to come up and get you? Do 
something, I tell you!
Mr. Van Daan. [Pushing her aside] Will you keep still!
[He goes over to the stairwell to listen. Peter goes to his mother, 
helping her up onto the sofa. There is a second of silence, then Anne 
can stand it no longer.]

Anne. Someone go after Father! Make Father come back!
Peter. [Starting for the door] I’ll go.
Mr. Van Daan. Haven’t you done enough?
[He pushes Peter roughly away. In his anger against his father 
Peter grabs a chair as if to hit him with it, then puts it down, 
burying his face in his hands. Mrs. Frank begins to pray softly.]
Anne. Please, please, Mr. Van Daan. Get Father.
Mr. Van Daan. Quiet! Quiet!
[Anne is shocked into silence. Mrs. Frank pulls her closer, holding 
her protectively in her arms.]
Mrs. Frank. [Softly, praying] “I lift up mine eyes unto the 
mountains, from whence cometh my help. My help cometh 
from the Lord who made heaven and earth. He will not suffer 
thy foot to be moved . . . He that keepeth thee will not 
slumber . . .” 
[She stops as she hears someone coming. They all watch the door 
tensely. Mr. Frank comes quietly in. Anne rushes to him, holding 
him tight.]
Mr. Frank. It was a thief. That noise must have scared him 
away.
Mrs. Van Daan. Thank God.
Mr. Frank. He took the cash box. And the radio. He ran away 
in such a hurry that he didn’t stop to shut the street door. It 
was swinging wide open. [A breath of relief sweeps over them.] I 
think it would be good to have some light.
Margot. Are you sure it’s all right?
Mr. Frank. The danger has passed. [Margot goes to light the 
small lamp.] Don’t be so terrified, Anne. We’re safe.
Dussel. Who says the danger has passed? Don’t you realize 
we are in greater danger than ever?
Mr. Frank. Mr. Dussel, will you be still!
[Mr. Frank takes Anne back to the table, making her sit down with 
him, trying to calm her.]
Dussel. [Pointing to Peter] Thanks to this clumsy fool, there’s 
someone now who knows we’re up here! Someone now 
knows we’re up here, hiding!
Mrs. Van Daan. [Going to Dussel] Someone knows we’re

a thief is going to go to the Green Police and say . . . I was

my head? You think a thief is going to do that?
Dussel. Yes. I think he will.
Mrs. Van Daan. [Hysterically] You’re crazy!
[She stumbles back to her seat at the table. Peter follows 
protectively, pushing Dussel aside.]
Dussel. I think some day he’ll be caught and then he’ll make 
a bargain with the Green Police . . . If they’ll let him off, he’ll 
tell them where some Jews are hiding!

Mr. Van Daan. He’s right.
Anne. Father, let’s get out of here! We can’t stay here now . . . 
Let’s go . . .
Mr. Van Daan. Go! Where?
Mrs. Frank. [Sinking into her chair at the table] Yes. Where?
Mr. Frank. [Rising, to them all] Have we lost all faith? All 
courage? A moment ago we thought that they’d come for us. 
We were sure it was the end. But it wasn’t the end. We’re 
alive, safe. [Mr. Van Daan goes to the table and sits. Mr. Frank 
prays.] 
“We thank Thee, oh Lord our God, that in Thy infinite mercy 
Thou hast again seen fit to spare us.” [He blows out the candle, 
then turns to Anne.] Come on, Anne. The song! Let’s have the 
song!

Mr. Frank urges her on. Her voice is hardly audible at first.]
Anne. [Singing]
“Oh, Hanukkah! Oh, Hanukkah! The sweet . . . 
celebration . . .”

still shaking with fear. Mrs. Van Daan sobs as she sings.]
